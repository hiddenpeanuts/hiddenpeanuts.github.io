  <title>I Love Bees: 20 Years Later</title>

<h1>I Still Love Bees</h1>
<div style="margin-left:20px; width:600px;">
<p>In 2004 we answered a ton of payphones. Two decades later I'm reflecting on that experience, and how it impacted my own view of the world.</p>

<p>20 years ago, podcasts barely existed as a concept. 20 years ago, we also got a ton of high quality audio drama from the game. Why not mash up the old and the new to celebrate?</p>

<p>Starting August 24th, <a href="tbd">this podcast feed</a> will release weekly chunks of the original I Love Bees audio drama - roughly in line with the anniversary of each original release. </p>

<p><strong>I'd love to hear from other Beekeepers along the way:</strong> </p>

<p>Record your own reflections as an audio file, email it to <a href="mailto:axonsonline@gmail.com">axonsonline@gmail.com</a>, and I'll add it at the beginning of one of the week's audio. You can also email text, images, etc, and I'll add it all to this page.</p>

<p>I take no credit for any of the ILB audio or web content, and stand on the shoulders of many puppet masters & player/archivists. The podcast feed will work through Summer 2025.</p>
