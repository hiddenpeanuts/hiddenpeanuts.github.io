<h1>I Still Love Bees</h1>
<div style="margin-left:20px; width:600px;">
<p>In 2004 we answered a ton of payphones. Two decades later I still think about it regularly, and nostalgia hits hard on anniversaries.</p>

<p>20 years ago, podcasts barely existed as a concept. We also got a ton of high quality audio drama from the game. Why not mash up the old and the new to celebrate?</p>

<p>Starting August 24th, <a href="https://www.hiddenpeanuts.com/feed/podcast/axons-online-ilb/">this podcast feed</a> will release weekly chunks of the original I Love Bees audio drama - roughly in line with the anniversary of each original release. </p>

<p><strong>I'd love to hear from other Beekeepers along the way:</strong> </p>

<p>Record your own reflections as an audio file, email it to <a href="mailto:axonsonline@gmail.com">axonsonline@gmail.com</a>, and I'll add it at the beginning of one of the week's audio. You can also email text, images, etc, and I'll add it all to this page.</p>

<p>I stand on the shoulders of many puppet masters & player/archivists <a href="https://www.thebruce.net/ilovebees">[1]</a> <a href="https://halo.bungie.org/misc/ilb_reordered/">[2]</a> <a href="https://wonderweasels.org/apiary/guide.htm">[3]</a>. The podcast feed will work through Summer 2025.</p>
