1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,580
I don't know about you guys, but I think we look great in these uniforms.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,920
Mine's scratchy.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,960
Okay, I mostly meant Jan and me look great.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,800
Gee, thanks.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,900
You, not so much.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,260
Jersey.

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:14,900
Yeah?

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,340
Some people, when they're nervous, they get all quiet.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,980
Yeah, I'm not really that type.

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:20,700
Try.

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,940
Okay, here comes the perimeter guard.

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,780
Try not to look guilty.

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,940
Welcome to Chawla Base.

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,020
Badges, please.

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,120
Oh, yeah, right.

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,880
They let you join up?

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,380
What are you, twelve?

18
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,980
What are you, fifty?

19
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,640
Watch that mouth, recruiting.

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,140
Let's everybody ease up.

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,120
You're doing your job, we're doing ours.

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,660
Okay.

23
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,980
But you, learn a little respect.

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,800
We're about to pass the Chawla ambient chatter firewall.

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Cut off all traffic.

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,960
There we go.

27
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,880
She's gone.

28
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,340
We'll get her back.

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,960
Okay, Jan, parking the non-uniform lot, let's go.

30
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,400
Okay, everybody ready?

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,100
There's still time to go back to my plan.

32
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,720
Huh.

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,820
So, we need a specific one or just any telecom shack?

34
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,320
Well, it depends on how they work.

35
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:23,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,760
Forget I asked.

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,880
According to Ronnie's schematic, this should be telecom shack number four.

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,240
Work your magic, geek boys, I'll be outside.

39
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,860
Good, yeah, you keep an eye out.

40
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,400
Keep down, guys, someone's coming.

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,660
Hey, who goes there?

42
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,780
And what's your chatter at?

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,040
Tech spec Lee, and that number's classified, buddy.

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,940
What you doing on my beat, making sure the servers don't get out?

45
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,020
Tech's at work, can't be too careful with these pack of monkeys.

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
Yeah, what's up with that?

47
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,800
I don't know, monkey stuff.

48
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,440
Hey, I'm new in Boston, what's worth seeing around here?

49
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,300
Well, there's a pretty cool scuba tour of the old subway tunnel.

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,200
You want a guide?

51
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,300
I'd be glad to volunteer.

52
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,840
It's it, wise place, alligator clips, I'll go over.

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,120
We've got to cross-link the channel protocol to the dark matter here and here.

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,280
We've gone over this.

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,100
What do you want to do?

56
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,740
Just sign a dirt code.

57
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,220
Damn it, come on, test the upload game.

58
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,300
Upling's fine.

59
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,040
Why is DERMA still outside?

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,840
You tell me.

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,440
Look, green light's all the way down.

62
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,420
Check your ports again.

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,840
Ports are perfect.

64
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,040
Probably something is mincing the input stream.

65
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,360
Try opening 100 consecutive data channels.

66
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:28,980
What?

67
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,800
Sometimes UNSC uses a spread spectrum arbitrator as an encryption augment.

68
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,000
What, what the what?

69
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,080
Jersey, just do it.

70
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

71
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,060
I'm in mobile and copying my primary data structure.

72
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,240
Copy complete.

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,020
Go team Jersey, go go team Jersey.

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,020
Good grief.

75
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,660
Man, it's nice in here.

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,960
Roomy, fast, cold.

77
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,300
Not like running on a jury-rigged home bandwidth mixer.

78
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,920
The Navy and I happen to have very different business partners.

79
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,440
What the hell was that?

80
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,460
Is Jan signaling something?

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,600
Yes, I believe I have a hot dog order in 50 bucks.

82
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,440
Whoa, good ears.

83
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,500
God, y'all were late.

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,700
I nearly chickened out three times.

85
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,800
So this is it.

86
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,000
Building 41.

87
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,860
These are the bank vault doors.

88
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,420
Yeah, for the first commercial bank of hell.

89
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,720
It would take a scorpion to get through these things.

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,200
According to base schematics, this door is the only entrance to the lockdown lab.

91
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,040
And the only way out, right?

92
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,400
Like if there's an alarm, all they have to do is sit on the other side of this door and wait for us to come through?

93
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,020
Right.

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,560
So…

95
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,260
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.

96
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,880
Would you knock that off?

97
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,200
So are we officially committing treason yet?

98
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,760
Jersey!

99
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Excuse me.

100
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,260
This entire building, including the clean room observation bay, is strictly red-badged and-

101
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,500
Security sweep!

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,060
I'm gonna have to ask you all to clear the building.

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,140
But the standing orders-

104
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,380
Sorry, orders.

105
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,220
I've gotta see some identification-

106
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:16,780
Man?

107
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,260
Do you know what the penalty is for chewing pick-up sticks on duty, private?

108
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,420
Pick-up sticks?

109
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,480
In your barracks, it's only a misdemeanor.

110
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,740
But as soon as you walk out of the building, you're not allowed to leave.

111
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,880
If you walked through the front door of a level 5 security zone, it became treason.

112
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,140
Did you know that, private?

113
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,120
Treason?

114
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,760
They broadcast the injections for treason, you know.

115
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,400
Whatever you need, ma'am.

116
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,120
Thank you.

117
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,400
Security sweep!

118
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,880
Please clear this wing immediately.

119
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,020
Leave all work untouched in its current location.

120
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,460
I repeat, this is a security sweep.

121
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,660
Did Durka give you the Marmore thing?

122
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,040
Didn't you see his tattoo?

123
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,820
That cross in the circle is a colorist.

124
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,300
They all come from Marmore, and the pick-up sticks.

125
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,600
And didn't see the stains on his teeth?

126
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,880
I like this girl.

127
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,700
Alright, team, let's begin our inspection.

128
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,120
Okay, we've got to work fast.

129
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,860
These security drills usually only last a couple minutes.

130
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,320
Wait!

131
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,740
There's still like five guys down in the clean room.

132
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,640
Oh, they look like big, gold-hitting bugs in those vests.

133
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,000
Didn't they hear the announcement about the security sweep?

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,200
I'm afraid they couldn't hear Ronnie through the other intercom.

135
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,660
Looks like the clean room is another black box.

136
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,440
You guessed.

137
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,220
That's bad.

138
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,320
I was hoping to use instruments to manipulate the artifact, but I can't get in there.

139
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,400
Someone is going to have to turn it off by hand.

140
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,420
Well, is it complicated?

141
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,580
Not really, but the room is full of argon.

142
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,720
And that's bad.

143
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,040
Two for two, boy genius.

144
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,360
Argon prevents corrosion and electrical arcing.

145
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,100
But you can't breathe it.

146
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,380
Okay, not breathing is bad.

147
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,020
Anyone ever put on a vaccine?

148
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,020
Jersey has.

149
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,220
You?

150
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, my dad.

151
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,120
There was an accident.

152
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,480
He got picked up after like ten hours in space.

153
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,180
They sent his vaccine home with momentum.

154
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,860
They used to put it on him ten hours a hell of a jump like stuff.

155
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,700
You look like such a dork running around the tenement in that thing.

156
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,020
But in a cute way, right?

157
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:05,880
Yeah.

158
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,740
Okay.

159
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,320
Well, I guess that means I'm going into the clean room.

160
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,680
Jersey shouldn't go.

161
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,020
Who should?

162
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,960
I don't know.

163
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,660
Someone else.

164
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,020
There are soldiers in there.

165
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,160
They're probably just techs.

166
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,260
They're techs with guns and military training.

167
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,380
Hey, hey, remember all that stuff you said about how a soldier's got to do his duty?

168
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,680
You aren't a soldier.

169
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,340
Covenant's coming, Durga.

170
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,060
Everyone's a soldier now.

171
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,240
Fine.

172
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,180
There's a vac suit locker right under this room with an airlock into the clean room.

173
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,140
Come on.

174
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,380
You come help me get this suit on.

175
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,020
There are B-ashes to yourself.

176
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,400
For all our superpowers, Durga can't even get the lid off a jar of pickles.

177
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,300
You got it.

178
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,640
If I get into trouble…

179
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,900
In a room full of argon?

180
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,780
Actually, I think I'm just dying.

181
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,640
Never mind.

182
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,340
Hey, Jersey.

183
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,380
Yeah?

184
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,680
Maybe you are the hero type.

185
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,800
Thank God for a soundproof airlock between the clean room and the vac suit locker.

186
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,180
Are you sure that's where your arm goes?

187
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,620
Want me to show you where my fist goes?

188
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,700
Yeah, yeah.

189
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,180
You're from the mean streets of the demob zone, I know.

190
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,140
Listen, if there's a leak in your suit, people will know you're suffocating until you're too late.

191
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh, that's comforting.

192
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,800
Triangles, lines, dots.

193
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,120
Durga, I got it already.

194
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,460
Triangles, dots, lines.

195
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,960
Jersey, try to concentrate.

196
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,120
I'm just messing with you.

197
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,500
Jersey.

198
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,520
Okay, come on.

199
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,760
Screw that helmet on tight.

200
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,540
I know I'm a hero and all, but even heroes can get these when they're dead.

201
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:39,870
Shit.

202
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,260
Triangles, lines…

203
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,940
Oh, I still say I'd feel better with a few flash grenades.

204
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,360
Durga!

205
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,740
I don't think it's a toggle like a light switch.

206
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,940
Triangles, lines, dots is a countdown.

207
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,920
Of course it is.

208
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,760
Jersey's got to do it the other way.

209
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,220
Dots, lines, triangles?

210
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:19,900
Yes!

211
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,780
Are you sure?

212
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,300
No!

213
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,120
Oh, great.

214
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,240
Telling Jersey now.

215
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,960
We're not sure what we're supposed to do to the artifact?

216
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,200
What if we guess wrong?

217
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,480
If we're lucky, we knock out the whole planet's comm channel and send a huge homing signal to the Covenant.

218
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,680
If we're lucky?

219
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,020
What happens if we aren't so lucky?

220
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,500
Well…

221
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:36,900
You know what?

222
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,740
Forget I asked.

223
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

224
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,740
There's Jersey.

225
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,420
He's in the room.

226
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,180
Yeah, oh.

227
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,100
The guy with the black badge just showed up at the front door.

228
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,160
I'm going down there to buy some time.

229
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:47,740
How?

230
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,100
Think of something.

231
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,400
Durga, dots, lines, triangles.

232
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,700
You've got that door jammed, right?

233
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,620
For now.

234
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,620
Okay.

235
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,240
I love airlocks.

236
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,200
Who doesn't love airlocks?

237
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:12,840
Smooth.

238
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,240
Good luck.

239
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,400
Thanks.

240
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:22,980
Okay.

241
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,020
Out with the air.

242
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
In with the argon.

243
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,320
Have you got it?

244
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,400
Yeah.

245
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,720
Dots, triangles, lines.

246
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Dots, lines, triangles, Jersey.

247
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,200
Jesus, Durga.

248
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,420
You just had to change it on me at the last minute.

249
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,560
Dots, lines, Jersey.

250
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,140
Don't go.

251
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,180
Not yet.

252
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,060
I gotta shut the airlock, kiddo.

253
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,900
We're out of time.

254
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,980
I'm scared.

255
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,980
Yeah, I'm scared too.

256
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,300
But it's what I gotta do.

257
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,440
Goodbye, Jersey.

258
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,000
Goodbye.

259
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,320
So far so good.

260
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,680
Just another gold-headed worker dude.

261
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,800
If they try to hurt him…

262
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,020
Durga, he'll be fine.

263
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,380
And frankly, you can't get into the clean room.

264
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
What could you really do?

265
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,540
I don't know.

266
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,660
Create a distraction.

267
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,700
Crash a plane into the base, say?

268
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,100
That seems a little extreme.

269
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,980
Acceptable casualties are part of every mission's calculus.

270
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,420
Okay…

271
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,980
And I take care of my people.

272
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:34,820
Top hat?

273
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,240
Top hat?

274
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,240
You call it Durga, top hats or dice?

275
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:39,900
Come on.

276
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,100
That's weird.

277
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:50,000
I might be shot to death in five minutes, but right now Jersey's on the other side of that door, either saving the planet or blowing it up, and I have absolutely nothing to do.

278
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,640
Tumbling dice!

279
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,660
Come on.

280
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,520
There's something you should know about Sophie.

281
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,020
She didn't go back to Aden.

282
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, well she didn't come to the bus station.

283
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,900
Top hat?

284
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,560
No.

285
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,160
They sent her to a refugee camp.

286
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,320
What?

287
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,920
A crooked immigration cop tried to get her to rat you out for your chips.

288
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,280
When she wouldn't betray you, he sent her to the camps.

289
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,040
Sophie…

290
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,120
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

291
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,340
I thought you would be more likely to come on this mission if you were willing to die.

292
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,920
Why the hell tell me now?

293
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,800
Now I want you motivated to live.

294
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,600
Damn it, I knew it.

295
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,180
What?

296
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,360
You really are just…

297
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,360
…

298
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:23,840
a brat.

299
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,080
I think it's jammed!

300
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,080
I'm a confused face running a dinner around.

301
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,860
This building is strictly red-matched enough!

302
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,120
What's that?

303
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,580
I'm sorry, I only have a green badge.

304
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,660
The door says I'm not cleared to open it.

305
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,680
Shit!

306
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,920
Uh, Durga?

307
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
Did I just hear the word grenade?

308
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,460
They're discussing options.

309
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,440
How much longer do I have to stall?

310
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,320
No more than…

311
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,080
Jersey!

312
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,180
Durga?

313
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,360
Jersey!

314
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,060
I see it.

315
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,080
I'll create a distraction.

316
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,660
Locating…

317
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,240
Durga, stop!

318
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,260
No crashing planes.

319
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,940
I'll handle it.

320
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,820
I'm going down there.

321
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,260
Jan?

322
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,120
Durga!

323
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,400
Overriding airlock.

324
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,960
You can't go in there without a vaccine!

325
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,460
I'll hold my breath!

326
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,860
I have no sensors in there.

327
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,540
Come on!

328
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,220
Jan has just taken out two…

329
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,300
no, three…

330
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,400
Jersey!

331
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:36,920
Jersey!

332
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:37,880
Jan!

333
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,260
Oh my god, what?

334
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,000
I think Jan just broke a guy's jaw with her elbow!

335
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,460
Jersey!

336
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,160
Jersey's alright, it's Jan!

337
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,440
She took a bullet!

338
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,080
Maybe you can slide a badge under the door!

339
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,360
Durga, what's happening?

340
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,660
The text jumped Jersey.

341
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,800
Jan ran down to help.

342
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,820
She took him out, but she took a bullet doing it.

343
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,080
Is she…

344
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,600
Not dead, not great.

345
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,040
She and Kamala are dragging a couple of guys with ruptured back suits out of the clean room.

346
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,800
There's a lot of blood on the back of her shirt.

347
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,340
I'm going through the door right now!

348
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,540
And Jersey, what about the artifact?

349
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,720
I can't get into the sensors there, but I think he's almost done.

350
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,480
That's the last!

351
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Durga, cycle the airlock!

352
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,500
Stay with me, girl.

353
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,140
You're not okay.

354
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:39,860
Hold still.

355
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,600
My neck, this is the head of my neck.

356
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,280
It feels kind of funny.

357
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,660
Look at me.

358
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,260
Pressure.

359
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,900
Okay, Jan, are you in a lot of pain?

360
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,180
No, not too bad.

361
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,920
I just can't breathe though.

362
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,560
I just got a screen when I took the bullet and I lost them all.

363
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,400
You may have inhaled some argon, but I think the human pneumothorax is your real problem.

364
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,200
Human pneumothorax?

365
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,800
Collapsed lung.

366
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,300
Okay, now turn gently.

367
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,240
The bullet entered just below your clavicle.

368
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,000
I broke your fifth rib on its way out.

369
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,340
Does that mean I have to quit smoking?

370
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,160
You should at least cut down.

371
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,000
Ow!

372
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,680
Okay, tilt your head up.

373
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Look at me.

374
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,780
Okay, dilation very good.

375
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,600
What's that?

376
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,520
It's my med kit.

377
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,380
I'm checking your vitals.

378
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,180
You feel dizzy?

379
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
That's fun.

380
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,580
Your vitals sound good.

381
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,080
Reliefly good actually.

382
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,180
You feel shocky at all?

383
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,780
Bad.

384
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,980
I feel shocky.

385
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,700
Okay listen, I've got splint tape.

386
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,400
I can't set that rib properly, but I can give it a little support so it doesn't hurt as much.

387
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,160
Not really.

388
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,280
That'd be good.

389
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,180
It's gonna feel a little warm when it activates, but it's set in about ten seconds.

390
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:50,860
You okay?

391
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,980
I'll give you blockers for the pain.

392
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,480
No, I don't need the blockers.

393
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,840
I want to be clear headed.

394
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,100
You could get shocky fast if something smacks your chest.

395
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,660
No, it's okay.

396
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,980
One point one.

397
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,480
Suck it!

398
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,460
Look, Jersey's back!

399
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:09,720
Jersey!

400
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,940
I did it!

401
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,060
We are not dead!

402
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,340
Module Core, average.

403
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,180
Warning, this medium is classified and has a strong intrusive inclination.

404
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,060
Warning, network anomaly has abroded.

405
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,200
What the hell is that?

406
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:28,900
Durga?

407
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,620
Is that you?

408
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,620
This medium has metastasized!

409
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,060
We aren't all dead yet!

410
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,930
Jesus jesus!

411
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,860
Help me!

412
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,480
I'm leaving!

413
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,840
Come on!

414
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,200
Durga, what the hell is going on?

415
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,620
This medium is widely invisible.

416
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,620
Make your seat in the room.

417
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,560
Help me!

418
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm gonna get the hold of it!

419
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,830
Uh oh.

420
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,330
Shit break!

421
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,810
We split!

422
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,550
We split!

423
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,110
We split!

424
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,650
Help me!

425
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,550
What the hell is that?

426
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,910
Jersey!

427
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,930
Playing on the beach.

428
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,210
Very young.

429
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,430
Making a castle out of sand.

430
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,470
It's way better than my brothers.

431
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,310
There's a boy on the beach next to him.

432
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,870
But a wave comes up, pulling him with his plasters, and takes away his face.

433
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,570
Asma.

434
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,510
It's me, Asma.

435
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,350
It's your brother.

436
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,330
Come on.

437
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,770
There are people who love me.

438
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,270
I will not be forgotten.

439
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,070
I will not be forgotten.

440
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,810
I will not be forgotten.

441
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,970
Come on.

442
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,070
Come on.

443
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,770
What's your name, Durga?

444
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,750
Sobek, sir.

445
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:09,890
Ronnie Sobek.

446
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:10,770
Analyst 3.

447
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,430
I work in Ms.

448
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,170
Lawson's department.

449
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,450
Please don't shoot me.

450
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,070
Well, Ms.

451
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,530
Sobek, would you mind telling me what you were doing in a level 5 security zone?

452
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,530
Lieutenant, take your men and make a quick sweep of the clean room.

453
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,070
No!

454
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:22,390
Sir!

455
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:23,430
What the hell?

456
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,430
It's mine, sir.

457
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,950
They mined it.

458
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:27,430
Who?

459
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,730
The terrorists, sir.

460
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,270
They mined the observation room and the clean room, too.

461
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,790
I heard them laughing about it.

462
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,310
Why?

463
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,050
Spaghetti and red sauce, sir.

464
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:36,570
What?

465
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,810
That's what they said.

466
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,110
First soldiers in the lab were going to be spaghetti and red sauce.

467
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,490
Lieutenant, send in the bomb squad.

468
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,350
Yeah, no kidding.

469
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,550
Ronnie's buying time.

470
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,990
No, it can't be much.

471
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,550
Access attempt unlocked.

472
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,310
Warning.

473
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,270
Continued attempts may trigger the exercise of people forced.

474
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,130
No, no!

475
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,910
We're helping each other, remember?

476
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,430
Yasmin, Durga!

477
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,830
Yasmin and Zaman, Spartan 2 voluntary recruitment.

478
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,010
16 September 25, 7.

479
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,670
Medical Qashq, 0.

480
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,550
I'll never stop missing you, Yasmin.

481
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,090
I thought of you every day.

482
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,190
Every day.

483
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,050
CC4, channel 2546.

484
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,290
This data is classified most secret and shall not be accessed by unauthorized personnel.

485
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,050
I'm not…

486
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,570
Sockingly excessive force is the best deterrent.

487
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,030
I'm not accessing your data!

488
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,310
Yasmin, what the hell have you done to Durga?

489
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,190
Look, bug out now, or we'll be talking together later.

490
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,130
A lot.

491
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,210
In a cell.

492
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,150
Okay, okay, so here's the thing.

493
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,390
We have to get back to a transmission shed and open the ports again.

494
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:45,990
What?!

495
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,410
She copied herself in, and we closed the ports.

496
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,850
She's got to copy her new self back out after this update.

497
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,290
Outside?

498
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,350
Same, Durga.

499
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,370
Inside?

500
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,490
Crazy one.

501
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,830
You want to let the crazy one…

502
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,330
Crazy stuff inside includes Yasmin, my sister!

503
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,570
Dude, she is seriously scrambled.

504
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,190
Let's just leave the scrambled one here.

505
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,290
Try it, and I will take a gun off of one of these tits and shoot you like a dog.

506
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,290
Oh crap.

507
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,630
Okay, change mission and mid-stride.

508
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,670
Just like every other general.

509
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,510
Okay, okay.

510
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,690
We'll do it your way.

511
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:24,410
Yeah, but Kamal, I could totally take you with one lung behind my back.

512
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,490
Warning.

513
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,750
Access violation.

514
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:28,550
Warning.

515
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,450
Access violation.

516
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,050
What the hell happened?!

517
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:31,870
It's the artifact.

518
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,190
When you triggered it, it attacked her or scrambled her or something.

519
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,570
And it woke up Yasmin.

520
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,130
Durga!

521
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,450
Can you hear me?

522
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,490
Durga!

523
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,110
Durga, if you're still in there somewhere, we really need your help.

524
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,050
I'm trying to hear you.

525
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:46,870
Yasmin!

526
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:47,890
I'm here.

527
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,690
Who's running the show in there?

528
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,830
I am.

529
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,270
Who?

530
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,310
Durga.

531
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,230
Are you sure?

532
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,650
It's getting easier to compartmentalize.

533
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,590
Nice to hear.

534
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,510
Okay, we need to find out what's happening to Ronnie, and we need to think of a way to get the freak out of here.

535
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,690
Run, Ronnie.

536
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,210
How long can it take for the damn bomb squad to get here?

537
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,290
There aren't mines or bombs, sir.

538
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,250
No, sir.

539
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,730
You say so, sir.

540
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,850
Only, this here is the only way out.

541
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:25,850
It won't hurt to get the bomb squad in here, because the terrorists won't be going anywhere.

542
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,590
Unless they figure out a way to come straight through the walls.

543
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,730
This medium is licensed to defend itself.

544
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,330
Make your decisions accordingly.

545
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:44,750
Hey, girl, I hope to tell your story this true, because something in that lab just put out the mother of all EMP spikes, dropped a chatt on it out to Saturn, and generated massive real space and slipspace signals.

546
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,610
If there's a better way to bring the Covies here, I can't think of it, sir.

547
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,710
Oh, my god.

548
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,290
You better hope God's on your side.

549
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,250
Bomb squad's asking for orders, sir.

550
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,510
Watch the prisoners in there.

551
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,770
If she moves, shoot her.

552
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,170
Hear that?

553
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,950
If I break the Covenant down, I'll deserve it.

554
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,430
They've got Ronnie.

555
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,430
Damn it.

556
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,150
But she gave me an idea for how we can get out of here.

557
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,370
Come on, guys.

558
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,450
These fellows are starting to wake up.

559
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,290
It's Star.

560
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,290
Start moving.

561
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,150
Out that door, I'm to the left.

562
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:22,890
Where are we going?

563
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,010
We're going to find an outside wall.

564
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,990
There's something bigger.

565
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,890
I was thinking.

566
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,770
It's me, Durga.

567
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,090
Somebody please tell me what you're thinking.

568
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,710
Ah, found something that will do nicely.

569
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,530
No other doors.

570
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,390
So we make one.

571
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,090
With what?

572
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,770
Our fists?

573
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,390
No, with a tank.

574
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,950
Durga will run it remote and use it to blow a hole in the side of a building.

575
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,990
Won't someone notice?

576
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,190
Not if there are enough distractions.

577
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,690
Oh, boy.

578
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,550
No flames I plow.

579
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,730
What's so funny?

580
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:54,750
Just thinking.

581
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,870
The first time we ever heard Jan, she was trying to sneak out of a base.

582
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,090
I hope this one works out better.

583
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,530
Scorpions rock!

584
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,090
When I get drafted, I want tank duty.

585
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,670
I want to stop being a medic and send people to hospitals where they belong.

586
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,450
Oh, yeah.

587
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,890
How did you get injured, miss?

588
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,750
Oh, breaking into a military base.

589
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,970
Durga, can you monitor her vital signs through this chatter?

590
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,390
Her vitals are fine, Kamal.

591
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:21,910
I know.

592
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,770
I just want to know if you can monitor.

593
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,950
Although, she peels faster than anyone I've ever seen.

594
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,090
I can really get to like pain blockers.

595
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,230
I feel all warm and drowsy.

596
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,090
I didn't take care of Ronnie.

597
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,270
Durga, we're flipping out.

598
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,210
You couldn't help it.

599
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,350
She's part of my crew.

600
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,570
They aren't going to give her the coma, are they?

601
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,750
Not if I can help it.

602
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,470
You think Standish will get a hold of her?

603
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,210
Standish?

604
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,270
Oh, no.

605
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,870
I'm not worried about Standish.

606
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,470
You're not?

607
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:53,730
It appears Standish has been implicated in some catastrophic security breaches at Chala Base.

608
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,110
Major Standish is in some difficulty.

609
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,670
Oh, man.

610
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,990
You're not going to stick the dog catcher on him, are you?

611
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,170
The dog catcher will be the least of the Major's worries.

612
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,610
So, did we do it?

613
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,670
Did we save the world?

614
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,710
Well, the world's still here.

615
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,830
For now.
