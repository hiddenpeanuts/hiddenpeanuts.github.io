1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,580
Sarah John.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,420
Hey Ronnie, I know it's late, but your chatter showed you available.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,920
Did you hear from Nick today?

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,740
I did.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,760
He is so hooked.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,980
They're transferring him to one of the space elevators.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,200
You cried, didn't you?

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,400
I did not.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,540
You cannot cry on the phone.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,340
Guys hate that.

11
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,620
Oh, I said it was allergies.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,300
I'm sure I didn't see through that.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,980
So what you doing up so late?

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,900
Trying to track down some guy.

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,980
Oh, is he cute?

16
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,980
Well, I've only heard his voice, but he sounds dreamy.

17
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,780
Likes to impress a girl with loud, cranky, belligerent tirades, and he can't be a day over 70.

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,280
I don't know, you don't do so well with tirades.

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,740
Oh, I'm sure I can change him.

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,380
So how does one go about tracking down this Romeo?

21
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,580
Well, my boss said I was using too many cycles at work pursuing this guy.

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,440
I'm sure your boss has her reasons.

23
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,860
That's what I'm afraid of.

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,800
Anyway, I'm going to try Pallas Athena, the Boston Public Library AI.

25
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,540
She's kind of stuck up, but she's smart.

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,220
Stuck up?

27
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,540
It's the accent.

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,460
So hov-ed.

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,880
You're such a hick.

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,860
So why the sudden interest in obnoxious men?

31
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,000
It's the guy who was pretending to be an evacuee from Troy.

32
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:18,980
Ronnie?

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,120
There's someone walking on my roof.

34
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,120
At 1 a.

35
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,340
m.?

36
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,260
Someone trying to break in?

37
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,400
I don't know.

38
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,220
Hello?

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,380
Is there somebody up?

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,080
Ronnie?

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,480
Ronnie, are you there?

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,460
Someone just fell off my roof.

43
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,780
Oh my god.

44
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,580
Okay, what was that?

45
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,080
I'll call you back.

46
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,820
Boston Emergency, may I help you?

47
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,980
I need to report an accident.

48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,200
I heard something on the roof and then someone fell to the street.

49
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,700
I'm headed down there now.

50
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,440
Don't you want to talk to Dad?

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,440
Not exactly.

52
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,900
So, I'm not going into the VA after all.

53
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,740
Are you sure?

54
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,260
Sweetheart, I'm never sure.

55
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,600
Well then maybe you should think-

56
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,340
Since Reach fell, I've been better.

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,800
Isn't that sick?

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,520
Now the enemy's closing in, people like me can be useful.

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,020
So, I got back on the meds.

60
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,800
Are you sleeping?

61
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,800
Finally.

62
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,020
I remember what clear and present danger looks like and it's not-

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,640
Kids on bicycles.

64
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,480
For example.

65
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,100
Hey, you about ready to go?

66
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,240
So I'm not going back to the hospital.

67
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,780
But you can't tell Dad, so-

68
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,700
You are a sharp little needle, aren't you?

69
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,860
Ready in a minute!

70
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
That's why you're calling me instead.

71
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,660
Right.

72
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,980
So I can-

73
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,240
Lie.

74
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,140
Right.

75
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,160
He's a hard man to lie to, but I'm guessing you're the expert.

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,540
Well, no life skill is ever wasted.

77
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,500
Tell Jim that Morales was in town and I got a ride with him.

78
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,600
Who are you talking to?

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,600
A friend.

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,100
That sounds good.

81
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,060
You sound a lot better.

82
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,280
But, take care, okay?

83
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:09,900
Thanks.

84
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,420
Are you at the scene of the accident?

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,540
Yes.

86
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:19,960
Oh God.

87
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,860
We have your location.

88
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,900
EMT in two minutes or less.

89
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,480
A record is being made of this occurrence.

90
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,740
Can you render medical assistance?

91
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,640
No, I think he's dead.

92
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,160
Can you check for a pulse?

93
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,480
Does the victim appear to be breathing?

94
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,960
He's not breathing at all.

95
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,460
What happened?

96
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,600
I don't know.

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,460
I don't know.

98
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,260
Off the road.

99
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,280
Is that bone?

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,440
Can you check for a pulse?

101
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,780
That's the skull.

102
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,200
That's messed up.

103
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,220
His head.

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm sorry.

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,940
I think it might be sick.

106
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,660
This is a normal reaction.

107
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,860
Please step away from the victim.

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,600
Do you feel faint?

109
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,300
No, I'm okay.

110
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,220
I don't think we need to check for a pulse.

111
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,280
I think he's dead.

112
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,080
I'm sure he's dead.

113
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,420
Do you know the victim?

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,240
No.

115
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,800
Does anybody know him?

116
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,940
You know the guy?

117
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,280
That guy that hangs out in front of the burrito place.

118
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,040
That's him.

119
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,320
He might be a homeless guy who stays in the neighborhood.

120
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,940
You don't want this jersey.

121
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,320
You don't know what I want.

122
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,460
I shouldn't have told you about the affair.

123
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,580
If I had been more clear headed, I wouldn't.

124
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,600
Yeah, but you did.

125
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,300
So who is the guy and when was the last time my mom saw him?

126
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,420
This is under the category of things you don't want to know.

127
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,900
You owe me this.

128
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,280
If you won't help save my dad, you owe me this.

129
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,420
Hi kiddo, I'm home.

130
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,500
You sure are.

131
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,240
Haven't seen that look in years.

132
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,020
Since you were ten maybe?

133
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,780
What look?

134
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,700
Well, I get stuck in traffic.

135
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,320
I'd come home and you'd be staring at the door with this mad face.

136
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,980
Like how dare I get home late?

137
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,040
So, how was downtown yesterday?

138
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,480
Fine, like any other day at work.

139
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,720
And dinner last night?

140
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,700
Was that fine too?

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,760
Dinner last night?

142
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,880
Dinner last night was…

143
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,440
Oh, oh Jerse.

144
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,060
Oh, oh Jerse.

145
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,440
I can't believe you.

146
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,120
I am not interested in going into this with you.

147
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,960
Oh, I bet not.

148
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,720
And dad's off in deep space getting shot at so you don't have to get into it with anyone except Simon.

149
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,440
Jersey, that's enough.

150
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,160
This guy's nothing, ma, a zero.

151
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,500
This is none of your business.

152
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,780
None of my business?

153
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,720
It's just my dad, your husband.

154
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,520
It is none of your business.

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,440
It's between me and your father.

156
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,040
And I don't like being spied on.

157
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,520
And I don't like that you're having an affair.

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,700
I'm not talking about this.

159
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,400
I'm telling him.

160
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,580
Fine, tell him.

161
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,420
You don't care?

162
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,980
It will hurt him but it's not gonna change him.

163
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,060
Are you doing this give back at him for being gone so much?

164
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,500
No.

165
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,880
When I met your father, I was working in Manhattan and there was your dad from North Bergen.

166
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,540
Yeah, I've heard this story already.

167
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,960
You met on the church hill ferry.

168
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,060
He was handsome, he was romantic.

169
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,820
He talked about his old broadcast and he played me songs.

170
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,860
Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky.

171
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,300
Stormy weather.

172
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,280
You're man and you ain't together.

173
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,100
It's hard to be married to a man who's living in 1971.

174
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,440
1941.

175
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:36,800
Whatever.

176
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,640
Unlike your father, Simon never thinks about anything that happened before he was born.

177
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,900
Because the man is a moron, Ma.

178
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,760
I like him.

179
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,080
All he talks about is business.

180
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,300
Yeah, your father hates worrying about money.

181
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,220
You're more like Simon that way.

182
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,180
Like Simon?

183
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,020
You live in the real world, Jers.

184
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,380
You helped me put food on the table and I am so grateful for that.

185
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,560
Like Simon?

186
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,940
He set up a pension thingy for me.

187
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,260
For the first time in my life, I'm not terrified of what's gonna happen to me when I get old.

188
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,660
I'll take care of you, Mom.

189
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,840
You don't need this creep.

190
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,580
Will you, Jers?

191
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,520
What if they send you off to fight, kiddo?

192
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,740
What if you decide you hate me because of something I've done?

193
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,120
Jesus, Mom.

194
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,380
That's not enough, Jersey.

195
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,380
I love you.

196
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,700
But it's not enough.

197
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,180
Mom, do you really like this guy?

198
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,000
God, your father could dance.

199
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,900
And I miss the dancing.

200
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,260
Jesus, Mom.

201
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,160
Don't cry.

202
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,940
No, you can tell the hospital he's gonna be DOA.

203
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,960
Head hit first.

204
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,180
Is he a jumper?

205
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,020
I don't know.

206
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,740
I heard something on the roof.

207
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,820
And then I heard him hit.

208
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,920
He must have been drunk or high.

209
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,300
Why would he be on the roof?

210
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Might live on one.

211
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Roofs are off the streets.

212
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,860
They feel safer.

213
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,180
Homeless people live all sorts of places.

214
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,380
His ankles aren't dirty.

215
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,720
Hey, you're right.

216
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,160
Certainly smells right, though.

217
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,540
And I'm grateful if any part of him's clean.

218
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,620
So how would his ankles be clean?

219
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,440
Also, there's blood in his ear.

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,760
He landed on his head.

221
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,180
No, I know, but it was the other side of his head.

222
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,820
Bad things happen when you hit face first.

223
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,680
What if he was bleeding from the ears before he fell?

224
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,620
Like, what if something happened to make him fall?

225
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,460
Lady, are you a coroner?

226
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,360
No.

227
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,500
Freeze?

228
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,600
No, it's just…

229
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,600
Then you should probably step back, because there ain't nothing you can do for this guy now.

230
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,700
Okay, he's loaded.

231
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,500
Let's get him to an ER so they can slab him.

232
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,820
Let me see one of those chips.

233
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,960
Oh, look, it's got a little video in it.

234
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,640
Oh, let me see.

235
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,740
They have a lavender one.

236
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,460
I probably just made you a millionaire.

237
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,760
What do you even call this color?

238
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,520
You mean yours?

239
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,380
Caramel?

240
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,080
I don't know.

241
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,040
Hanneos.

242
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,520
Toffee.

243
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:04,960
Hero.

244
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,480
You need a girlfriend.

245
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,360
I'm colorblind, and I don't need a girlfriend.

246
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,540
There's you and me, right?

247
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,320
Our affair?

248
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,740
Our affair's a secret, hero.

249
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,500
And all guys are colorblind.

250
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,320
Just for some guys, it's biological.

251
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,020
Ouch.

252
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,660
Does yours have the same video?

253
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,780
Mine's got a fountain.

254
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,980
That's from in front of the casino.

255
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,480
Mine has tumbling dice.

256
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,220
Let me see one of the tangerine ones.

257
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,080
Oh, it's got a little tap dancing girl at the top hat.

258
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,800
Let's see.

259
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,780
Lady Luck?

260
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,520
Hold on.

261
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,740
Oh, slipstream packet.

262
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,220
It's my mom.

263
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,880
This'll be good.

264
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,280
Put it on speaker.

265
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,280
I want to hear your mom's voice.

266
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,400
Okay.

267
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,280
Kamal, hello.

268
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,020
Such a nice letter you sent.

269
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,780
Your father says to tell you he is proud of you, and we are so proud to have a doctor in the family.

270
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,040
So proud?

271
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,520
Everyone is good here.

272
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,920
Have you been eating okay?

273
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,640
Eating salads and things you have trouble in the bathroom if you don't eat enough roughage.

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,160
I only say that because your father is the same as-

275
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,060
Okay, we're done here.

276
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,840
Kamal, don't be a baby.

277
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,560
She's so sweet.

278
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,680
Absolutely not.

279
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,420
Kamal.

280
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,320
Yes?

281
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,000
Have you ever won an argument with me?

282
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:13,760
Sophia.

283
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,020
Ever?

284
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,280
No, man.

285
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,940
Oh, God.

286
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,440
Oh, God.

287
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,280
Oh, God.

288
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,200
Sophie?

289
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,300
Read some stuff.

290
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,020
No, it's okay.

291
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,520
Hiro.

292
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,420
Hiro didn't have to leave.

293
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,400
Sophie, I-

294
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,020
It was barely a marriage, you know.

295
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,840
I'm so sorry.

296
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,260
I shouldn't have played the message.

297
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,360
No, no, no.

298
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,240
I asked you to.

299
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,820
You couldn't know.

300
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,260
I'm just surprised.

301
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,180
I've known Akazma my whole life.

302
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,140
She and my father have always been friends and she's a good person.

303
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,160
Bitch.

304
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,180
Hey, Kamal, I'm at the door.

305
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,240
Open up, guys.

306
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,260
I brought beer.

307
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,940
Herzog, you just can't barge into a meeting.

308
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,200
Admiral!

309
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,500
I will turn this department upside down if I don't get some accountability for this.

310
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,260
Ensign, call security.

311
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,040
Herzog, come on.

312
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,680
You can't stomp into a meeting that's already taking place.

313
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,440
Herzog, what's this all about?

314
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,560
It was my understanding that wetwork required executive authorization.

315
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,260
Oh, God.

316
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,440
Come on, not this again.

317
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,080
Wetwork?

318
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,640
I didn't authorize a termination.

319
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,900
What are you talking about?

320
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,220
I'm talking about a black op on the roof of a 22-year-old analyst's apartment.

321
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,180
That's preposterous.

322
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,620
What black op?

323
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,340
The one that my security eliminated.

324
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,140
You've got no proof, my friend.

325
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,100
You want me to drop his smoking boots on the desk?

326
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,240
Of course I've got proof.

327
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,100
Standish, shut up.

328
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,880
Herzog, sit down.

329
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,980
Standish, you're dismissed.

330
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,340
Admiral!

331
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,880
Close the door as you leave.

332
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,140
Again.

333
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:23,960
Again?

334
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,680
Please.

335
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,920
All right.

336
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,940
Jersey, there's something you should know about your father.

337
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,480
Pause.

338
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,380
I was so sure she was about to say he started the affairs.

339
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,400
He left us both.

340
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,060
He was never the guy you thought he was.

341
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,620
Should I keep going?

342
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,580
Yeah.

343
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,260
Your father always, always loved you.

344
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,760
So did I.

345
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:47,820
Again?

346
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,560
Again.

347
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,880
I'm the Casco.

348
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,820
You're the black taxi?

349
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,620
That's me.

350
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,920
You really drive offline?

351
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,420
No road wear, nothing?

352
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,640
Baltimore, right?

353
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,540
He must have some kind of reflexes.

354
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,960
Whenever he crashes a car, we send a refund to the next of kin.

355
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,240
Chan, he's the girl.

356
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,180
You want to chat?

357
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,080
Get a regular cab.

358
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,760
Stay on the grid.

359
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,460
Use your ID.

360
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,100
Hey, it's all good, man.

361
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,740
I heard you were the best.

362
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,300
Uh-huh.

363
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,320
Wow, Dad, you sound really cool.

364
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,120
Could you just get in already?

365
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,520
I got bad nerves.

366
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:35,980
Want some?

367
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,300
Great idea.

368
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,440
No thanks.

369
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,980
My crew, there's a flu going around.

370
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:42,640
Flu?

371
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,180
Yeah, the kind where when you get it, you fall under a bus.

372
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:46,900
Damn.

373
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,980
Yeah, I hate that kind.

374
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,540
So what's with the splint on your arm?

375
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,840
Brakes went on my hog.

376
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,420
It could have happened to anyone.

377
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,060
Why?

378
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,520
We were blacked out.

379
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,340
Some weird freakiness went down.

380
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:57,900
Oni?

381
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,820
With the bullet?

382
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,360
She think I'm crazy.

383
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,420
Actually, when it comes to paranoia, you're among friends.

384
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,840
Hey, Chan, I just ran the tool crib.

385
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,460
I didn't know nothing about nothing.

386
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,380
Macasko.

387
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,620
Don't tell it to us, all right?

388
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,700
Don't tell us anything.

389
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,700
You sound like the op.

390
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,540
The op?

391
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,540
Old friend.

392
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,100
She gave me the same advice.

393
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,220
Thank you, Colonel.

394
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,900
I'll look into this matter immediately.

395
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,440
You're dismissed.

396
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,060
And send in Stannish on your way out.

397
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,460
Thank you, Admiral.

398
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,340
Stannish, the Admiral wants to see you.

399
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,760
Herzog, this is a mistake.

400
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,920
No, Stannish.

401
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,560
The mistake was putting an assassin on a 22-year-old girl's rooftop.

402
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,920
Even if there was an assassin?

403
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,400
Because you put one there for political reasons.

404
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,180
Because you are afraid of what an investigation might do to your career.

405
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,060
Oh, not my career, Herzog.

406
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:07,520
Oh, and before you go getting on your moral high horse, who is using that 22-year-old girl?

407
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,060
And who is hiding the most powerful object ever to fall into our hands?

408
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,780
There is a war going on, my friend.

409
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,700
For us to remain human, not slaves.

410
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,260
For us to be free people.

411
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,840
My conscience doesn't keep me awake at night, Herzog.

412
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,940
That's very frightening, Stannish.

413
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,520
Mine keeps me awake every night.

414
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,620
Stannish!

415
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,340
Watch your back, Herzog.

416
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,520
Because I'm not going to let you or anyone else lose this war.

417
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,040
It's 3 AM, Sarah John.

418
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,840
You don't have to keep talking to me.

419
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,140
Why, you think you're going to be able to sleep now?

420
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:45,900
Yeah.

421
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,380
No, his head, it was…

422
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't think about it.

423
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,300
Just think of something else.

424
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,020
What are you doing?

425
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,020
Nothing.

426
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,420
You think that guy was just pretending to be a bum.

427
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,180
That's why his ankles were clean.

428
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,180
That's what you're thinking.

429
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,060
No, I'm not.

430
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,720
Ronnie, don't get spooky.

431
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,880
Not tonight.

432
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,160
Tomorrow you can do it, but not tonight.

433
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:09,880
Okay.

434
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,360
I can hear you typing, Ronnie.

435
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,520
It's just stuff for work.

436
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,960
Like hell it is.

437
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,720
Sarah John, don't worry.

438
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,700
Just get on the bed.

439
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,420
You think this is about you.

440
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,200
You think that guy on the roof was coming for you.

441
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:23,940
I don't.

442
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,220
You know how your mind works.

443
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,240
You're thinking of that old hard sound rifle Billy J got black marked.

444
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,760
But Sarah John…

445
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,860
You're thinking somebody used one just like it to drop that guy and let the ball finish him.

446
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,100
I am not.

447
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,000
Swear it.

448
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,600
What?

449
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,600
Swear it.

450
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,260
I swear.

451
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,160
Liar.

452
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,740
Why did you ever have to take that damn job?

453
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,760
I am so sorry, Sarah John.

454
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,420
But I'm in too far.

455
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,940
They're never going to let me get out now.

456
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,200
Okay.

457
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,480
Here we are.

458
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,360
Hey, Jan, why don't you get out too?

459
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,000
You can ride up front on the way home.

460
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,500
Thanks, man.

461
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,080
Yeah, yeah.

462
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,060
Hey, it's no problem.

463
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,060
Hey, Caskell.

464
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,880
Yeah?

465
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,240
I, uh, hope we never see each other again.

466
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,600
Yeah.

467
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,120
Yeah.

468
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,360
Hey, man.

469
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,300
Sounded sane enough to me.

470
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,900
Is there actually any difference between you and your usual fare?

471
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,440
Sure.

472
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,540
They have to sit on the passenger side.

473
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,380
But about the paranoia thing.

474
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,680
I am not moving to freaking Mexico.

475
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,500
Ha ha ha.

476
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,500
Yeah, you saw the mask.

477
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,940
And the real estate ads.

478
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,500
Come on, I got C's in Spanish, Dad.

479
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,300
Yeah, I know you can cuss in it.

480
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,460
Oh, merd.

481
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,080
Look, when you got picked up by the cops a couple of weeks ago, I just did some checking around.

482
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,200
Not again.

483
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,060
You promised me we didn't have to move anymore.

484
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,000
It never snows in Mexico.

485
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,580
Dad.

486
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,120
So, who was that on your chatter right before we left?

487
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,600
Oh, yeah.

488
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,740
That was Gilly.

489
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,180
She said Morales would give her a ride to the hospital.

490
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,560
You don't need to drive her.

491
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,200
Yeah, she said this guy Morales was in town, you know, just kind of visiting, so…

492
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:20,700
Jan.

493
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,760
How many times do I have to tell you?

494
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,380
If you want to sell the lie, don't keep talking.

495
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,280
I can't help it.

496
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,560
You always wait me out.

497
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,180
It's not like we don't practice this stuff.

498
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,800
What if I would maybe…

499
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,960
Maybe interrogate her.

500
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,600
I know.

501
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,560
So how did she sound?

502
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:35,740
Better.

503
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,460
I should see her before.

504
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,160
Wait.

505
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,700
Wait.

506
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,200
Stop the car.

507
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,000
Stop the car!

508
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,380
What is it?

509
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,740
That water tower with the big crab on it.

510
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,200
What?

511
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,000
I remember all this stuff.

512
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,060
We used to live here.

513
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,140
You remember that?

514
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,620
Yeah.

515
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,100
Yeah, last year of preschool.

516
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,120
I remember…

517
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,480
Oh, Dad, put the gun down.

518
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,480
Good grief.

519
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,280
Sorry.

520
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,980
I remember I had these curtains.

521
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,760
Yeah, they had horses on them.

522
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,340
The merry-go-round horses.

523
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,940
So, why did we have to move so much?

524
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,280
You hated that.

525
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,780
Like I would just get settled in and then bam.

526
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,880
I was recruited.

527
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,060
What?

528
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,320
Spartan program.

529
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
I was recruited.

530
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:22,640
Yeah?

531
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,540
That's not how they do it now with the 2.

532
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,460
0s.

533
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:25,940
The 2.

534
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,660
0s, they just take.

535
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,480
Take?

536
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,760
Six years old.

537
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:30,740
Take?

538
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,780
Six years old.

539
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,400
They snatch and train and tweak them.

540
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,860
Years and years of it.

541
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,980
Not even the Navy would…

542
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,800
Oh, never mind.

543
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,360
By the time they're 14, they're barely human.

544
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,240
Then they give them a last set of tweaks to finish the job.

545
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,220
Oh my God.

546
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,020
A lot of them die.

547
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,100
The ones that don't, those are the 2.

548
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,740
0s.

549
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,600
How do you know this stuff?

550
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,840
Hey, look.

551
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,980
It's Cavettis.

552
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:52,860
Cavettis?

553
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,760
Oh my God.

554
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,360
We used to come here for ice cream in the summer.

555
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,240
Dad, come on.

556
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,200
We've got to stop.

557
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,180
They're probably closed.

558
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,680
No, they're not.

559
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,400
They closed up in the winter.

560
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,980
Dad, look.

561
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,400
You've got to stop.

562
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,040
Oh man, the special is pumpkin pie ice cream.

563
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,520
I totally remember that.

564
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,260
Do you remember that?

565
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:11,720
That's right.

566
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,440
They were open until Halloween.

567
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,880
And you did not understand how good it was.

568
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,460
It was so good.

569
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh my God.

570
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,560
We came here with Mom once, didn't we?

571
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,300
I just remember this lady.

572
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,440
I didn't know who she was.

573
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,340
But I remember her and she was smiling.

574
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,400
It won't be the same, Jen.

575
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,340
Jen, remember there's milk shortages.

576
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,280
There's rationing.

577
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,020
It's just like I remember.

578
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,760
Only the counter used to be so tall.

579
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,160
Things aren't like they were.

580
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,300
What can I get you?

581
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,760
I'll have a scoop.

582
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,740
Two scoops of pumpkin pie and a waffle cone.

583
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,620
And he'll have…

584
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,500
Wait, I remember.

585
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,980
A marshmallow sundae with chocolate ice cream.

586
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,840
With whipped cream and peanuts.

587
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,700
Okay, be right up.

588
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,140
God, I can't believe you ever made us move away from Cavettis.

589
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,720
Yeah, so the summer we lived here…

590
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,320
I mean, they still have the same sign.

591
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,200
I remember that sign.

592
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,880
You were really good at hopscotch.

593
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,660
You killed Daddy.

594
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,680
Dad, it's hopscotch.

595
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,260
How do you kill with hopscotch?

596
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,440
You can do it on your hands.

597
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,440
So one day your kindergarten teacher, Miss Taylor, she…

598
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,260
She tells me there's a guy from the Ministry of Education observing you in class.

599
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,400
Study on gifted children, she said.

600
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,000
She was so tickled by that.

601
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,820
Four days later, I shot someone in our backyard.

602
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,160
Oh my God, but…

603
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,640
I knew this tech once.

604
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,620
Long story, but he worked on the 2.

605
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,660
0s.

606
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,520
Nerve regeneration, 14-year-olds in neutral buoyancy tanks, their bones twisted like pretzels.

607
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,640
That's why we moved?

608
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,580
And you were pegging the test scores, Jan.

609
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,020
You were so smart.

610
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,580
And you were killing.

611
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,800
You were killing everyone at hopscotch.

612
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm so sorry.

613
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,260
I…

614
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,260
I didn't know.

615
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,860
I couldn't risk it, Jan.

616
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,520
Gilly had already gone to this place, this dark place.

617
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,520
You were all I had.

618
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,840
Here's your ice cream.

619
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:16,760
And that time I got in the news for rescuing that stupid cat on the church roof, and then we moved to Idaho.

620
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,940
Oh my God.

621
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,540
You had to quit your job, sell the house, and forget about a girlfriend.

622
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,160
Thanks.

623
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,540
These, uh, these look great.

624
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,760
Here, you keep the change.

625
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,420
Thanks.

626
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,740
Have a good one.

627
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,000
You grab some napkins, would you, Jan?

628
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,080
Dad…

629
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,040
Don't worry about it.

630
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,680
No, but I…

631
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,840
This is Cavetti's melting on my hand here, Jan.

632
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,180
Napkins.

633
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,940
Roger that.

634
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,020
Here's yours.

635
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,840
Lick fast.

636
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,420
Yes, sir.

637
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,920
Don't be disappointed.

638
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,260
Things are never how you remember.

639
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,760
Oh my God.

640
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,180
Is it okay?

641
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,340
Oh my God.

642
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,140
It is just like I remembered.

643
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,000
It is so good.

644
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,200
I can't believe you don't love this stuff, Dad.

645
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,000
Taste it.

646
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,980
Isn't it great?

647
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,120
It's…

648
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,120
okay.

649
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh, freak.

650
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,100
It's the best.

651
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,040
Oh God, I am so happy.

652
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,240
Thank you so much.

653
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,180
It's just ice cream.

654
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,540
Yeah.

655
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:25,980
I know.

656
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,700
Hey, Hirola.

657
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,420
Aiden, Sophia just got some bad news about her parents.

658
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:36,940
Aiden?

659
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,560
Aiden?

660
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,620
You have to get her here.

661
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,860
Baby, baby, Soph.

662
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,440
Aiden, you gotta get her off, Carl.

663
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,240
Who, baby?

664
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:43,780
What's wrong?

665
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,200
Mom and Daddy left her.

666
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,920
Come on, sit down.

667
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,080
It'll be okay, Soph.

668
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,760
Tell me what's going on.

669
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,620
I just heard that my Dad left Carl with another woman, and my Mom is still there, but by herself.

670
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,100
Okay.

671
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,240
You have to get her here.

672
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,100
I can get her paperwork again, baby, but if she won't leave, I can't make her.

673
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,180
You've gotta make her.

674
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,740
I'll get her paperwork updated.

675
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,540
Well, what if you're right?

676
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,320
What if she won't leave?

677
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,720
Maybe she will now.

678
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,560
There's nothing left for her there.

679
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,380
Should I put the beer in the fridge?

680
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,960
How could she let him do this to her?

681
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,960
When she's depressed, she won't do anything.

682
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,100
She won't leave, Carl.

683
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,540
No glass, and she'll still be there.

684
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,000
No one knows what's gonna happen.

685
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,520
Everybody knows what's gonna happen.

686
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,280
We've gotta bring her here.

687
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,220
I'm sorry.

688
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,740
I'm being stupid.

689
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,880
It's not stupid.

690
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:34,780
It's okay.

691
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,320
Aiden, I wanna go home.

692
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay.

693
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,400
I'm sorry, Sophia.

694
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,280
It's just…

695
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,940
Anna, she makes me so mad.

696
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,700
Aiden, take care of her.
