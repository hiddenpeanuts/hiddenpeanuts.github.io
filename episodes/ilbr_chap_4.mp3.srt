1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,840
Hello?

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:16,960
Hello?

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,260
Who's there?

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,220
You're freakin' chatter.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:19,960
Drop it.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,600
And your wallet.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,320
I'm dropping it.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,160
I'm putting it down slowly.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,700
I'm a student.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,960
Any funny business, I'm gonna cut you up.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,420
Broker than you are.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,720
Look at those shoes you're wearing.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,780
I didn't tell you you could talk!

14
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,640
Those are commissary shoes.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,380
Shut up!

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,840
And the haircut.

17
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,520
Haircut?

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,520
I said shut up!

19
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,060
Spiky hair.

20
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,400
Instead of worrying about my haircut, you should worry about your throat.

21
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,040
Are you a cop?

22
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,380
I kill cops.

23
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:47,800
No.

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,820
No undercover would wear those shoes or go out on the street with a Sigma Chi fraternity tattoo.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,440
Hey, I-

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,740
I'm a student from a place where overalls are form aware and even I look outside once in a while.

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,820
But you don't-

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,440
I know who you are.

29
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:01,980
Who?

30
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,060
You're with Intelligence College, boy.

31
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,200
Wait a second!

32
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,220
This is about that spy job.

33
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,700
You guys can't do this to people.

34
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,560
It's illegal.

35
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,740
How'd you like me to rip your arms off?

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,680
For crying out loud, could you at least stop grinning at me?

37
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,260
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,220
It's just something I do when faced with the ridiculous-

39
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,280
It's a test for new recruits.

40
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,380
You did great.

41
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,120
Great?

42
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,200
Geez, you don't even look like a Boston thug.

43
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,720
You look like something out of Central Casting.

44
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,500
And I'm not a recruit.

45
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,640
I'm not interested.

46
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,860
Because of the tattoo?

47
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,800
Nobody ever noticed it before.

48
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,720
I live in Southie.

49
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,160
My landlady is scarier than you.

50
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,820
Think about your country.

51
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,900
Take the job.

52
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,240
What?

53
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,200
I get two years of spy school and then I get to hang out in alleys scaring civilians?

54
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,120
Jesus.

55
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,500
Look, could I walk home with you?

56
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,320
You could at least show me what people wear in your neighborhood.

57
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,040
No.

58
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,940
I'd die of embarrassment.

59
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,920
Morons.

60
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,340
Mr.

61
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,860
Morelli.

62
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,660
We will be making a record of this audit.

63
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,160
My name is George Shapur.

64
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,520
I'm an associate fiscal investigator.

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,640
You have the right to have your accountant present.

66
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,420
Yeah, I do my own books.

67
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,120
I see.

68
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,740
Trust me, Jersey, your books are fine.

69
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,480
You know, I don't really make a lot of money and an accountant is expensive.

70
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,820
And the computer's supposed to be good at it, so-

71
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,980
It's not your computer I worry about.

72
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,220
Your first mistake.

73
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,760
Your record seems a little half-hazard, Mr.

74
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,180
Morelli.

75
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,140
As I must say, that's your style of dress.

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,580
George Shapur has been working here nine years.

77
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,880
Employee performance records say he is precise, punctual, efficient, arrogant, and not-well-liked.

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,660
Still, he was going to be promoted next month.

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,120
What?

80
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,980
Excuse me, Mr.

81
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,380
Morelli?

82
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,120
No, nothing.

83
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,200
Now he's getting a pay cut and a job rotation to Alaska.

84
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,880
Hmm.

85
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,640
Your return seems better organized than I remembered.

86
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,000
A little housekeeping, just better records, and you know, a few more of them.

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,820
Does it seem warm in here to you?

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,480
No.

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,500
It's probably refreshingly cool in Alaska right now.

90
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,380
Well, the four thermostats must be acting up.

91
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,900
These old government buildings.

92
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,860
Do you mind if we move a little to the left?

93
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,620
Shouldn't be doing that.

94
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,420
But now it's getting warm here.

95
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,240
It really shouldn't be doing that.

96
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,660
In fact, it should stop.

97
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,700
I know, but I don't think that's going to happen, do you?

98
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm afraid you'll have to reschedule your audit, Mr.

99
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:37,680
Morelli.

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,320
I can't be expected to work under these conditions.

101
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,460
I'd hate to have to come back because of a problem with the thermostat.

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,080
Fine.

103
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,240
Ah, it's cooling off.

104
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,200
That's better.

105
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,200
Much better.

106
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:48,880
Wait.

107
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,400
Now it's the light.

108
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,800
I'm getting light shining right in my eyes.

109
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,880
Damn it.

110
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,040
It's something with the traffic.

111
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,300
It's following me.

112
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,660
Oh, you be good cop.

113
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,700
I want to be the bad cop.

114
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,380
I'd really just like to get this over with.

115
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,580
This will take as long as it takes, Mr.

116
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,100
Morelli.

117
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,940
And nothing you say or do will make it go one second faster.

118
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,460
Mistake number two.

119
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,480
Sabura here.

120
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,720
I'm in the middle of an audit.

121
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,760
My wife?

122
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,500
Well, tell her I'll call her back.

123
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,100
Alright, alright.

124
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,120
I have to step out for a moment.

125
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,280
Her first marriage is second.

126
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,880
When asked why she wanted a divorce, his first wife Linda said that it was that or die of boredom.

127
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,840
Tell me you didn't.

128
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,980
Oh, you mean the slut chat bill sent to the family account?

129
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,120
Clearly a glitch.

130
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,740
Durga, stop it.

131
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,420
Uh, Mr.

132
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,560
Morelli.

133
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,440
Actually, your return seems perfectly adequate.

134
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,080
Just, you know, try to be a little bit more careful with your records.

135
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,060
George, this is Shabura?

136
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:49,880
Yes?

137
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,140
Office of the Treasury.

138
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,460
I have a warrant for your arrest on 14 counts of countag-

139
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,860
What?

140
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,360
Everybody down on the ground!

141
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,480
What the hell is this?

142
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,060
Police!

143
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,380
Damn.

144
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,740
You are under arrest.

145
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,960
Stand with your hands out away from your sides.

146
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,780
You have the right to remain silent.

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,760
What do you mean counterfeiting?

148
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,300
Counterfeiting?

149
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,880
Not counterfeiting, assault!

150
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,120
We have a warrant armed and dangerous.

151
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,860
It was just supposed to be a simple audit.

152
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,940
You want him for assault?

153
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,100
I get him for counterfeiting.

154
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,580
Enviro department, everybody must vacate the premises.

155
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,300
Freeze!

156
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,420
Down on the ground!

157
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,340
Would you knock that off already?

158
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,180
I have a report of a hazardous chemical contamination.

159
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,720
Nobody leaves until I've secured the suspect.

160
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,300
This is all a mistake.

161
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,020
Jesus Christ, who's the guy with the big gloves?

162
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,020
Animal control.

163
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,120
So, which one of you scum is the guy who's schemed for trading in wild honey badgers has gone so terribly, terribly wrong?

164
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,400
I don't even have a dog.

165
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,740
What the hell?

166
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,480
Is that really?

167
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,140
Oh, hey.

168
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,020
Thank you.

169
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,240
Hello, and welcome to Hot, Kien, Cold.

170
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,360
Please, place your thumb on the transaction plate.

171
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,820
Hey, Bev, you are looking great.

172
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,860
Have you lost weight?

173
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,820
Thank you.

174
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,820
I'm afraid I don't know the answer to your question.

175
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,080
What beverage can I offer you?

176
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,580
Coffee, black, two sugars.

177
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,580
Gladly, Miss James.

178
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,120
You know, I saw the candy machine across the room eyeing you again.

179
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,020
Thank you.

180
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,340
Can I interest you in a snack food?

181
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,480
Oh, I know, and the way his out of stock button flashes is so cute.

182
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,500
Thank you.

183
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,100
My inventory is replenished Mondays and Fridays.

184
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,420
Well, you'll want to make your move soon, sister.

185
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,720
I hear the fire suppression system here really puts out.

186
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,700
Thank you.

187
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,440
Well, you sure don't want to lose him to that slutty cash register, do you?

188
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,400
Thank you.

189
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,340
I'm afraid I don't know the answer to your question.

190
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,880
Enjoy your beverage.

191
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,560
Oh, Bev, you kidder.

192
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,260
How about tomorrow you buy?

193
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,420
Thank you.

194
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,400
I'm afraid I don't know the answer to your question.

195
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,380
Hey, excuse me?

196
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,500
Look, I know this is kind of weird, but…

197
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,740
Hey, I need a guy's opinion.

198
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,220
Yeah?

199
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,780
Be honest with me here.

200
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,120
You see that coffee dispenser?

201
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,080
Yeah?

202
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,880
Would you go out with her?

203
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,580
She's too heavy, right?

204
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,180
No, no, I mean…

205
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,380
Men are such pigs.

206
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,700
Look, you're the girl that was at Shafi's last week, aren't you?

207
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,380
Never heard of it.

208
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,040
Are we done?

209
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,480
Hey, I need help.

210
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,860
I know you're the kind of person who helps.

211
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,700
I was there, I saw it.

212
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
So, don't pretend you're just like them.

213
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,840
Maybe last week was the pretending.

214
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,820
So keep pretending.

215
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,260
Sit down.

216
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,720
Buddy of mine, Gene Lindsay, goes by the name Optical these days.

217
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,260
We've been hanging out with these guys and Gene's in pretty deep, you know, he's in…

218
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,240
Trouble?

219
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,140
Yeah.

220
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,080
So, your friend wants to move up in the world.

221
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,420
Well, they want to let him, but first he's got to…

222
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,140
Finish eighth grade?

223
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,740
Prove himself.

224
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,860
He has to do something they can hold over him forever.

225
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,780
Hmm, this'll be fun.

226
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,380
Well, I'll be damned.

227
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,260
Kamal!

228
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,580
Just the guy I wanted to see.

229
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,300
Oh, no.

230
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,280
Aiden, hey, what are the odds?

231
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,280
Too late to get a beer?

232
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,380
No, sugar, you got fifteen minutes to spare.

233
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,420
Okay, one for me, one for him, whatever's good.

234
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,240
I don't want a beer.

235
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:28,780
Sure you do.

236
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,400
No, I don't.

237
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,500
Kamal, come on.

238
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,080
Hey, I like the way that sounds.

239
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,400
Kamal, come on.

240
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,580
Kamal, come on.

241
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,460
Never mind.

242
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,780
I hate drinking by myself.

243
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,800
Have a beer with me.

244
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,400
I'm buying.

245
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,680
I'll buy your burger, too.

246
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,400
Well…

247
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
That's my dark genius of the bit stream.

248
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,020
Two beers, coming up.

249
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,320
So I have a friend who has this problem.

250
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:47,840
No.

251
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,660
Oh.

252
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,540
So how are your parents?

253
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,860
I can help them, you know?

254
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,620
I know.

255
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,260
Come on, Kamal, this friend of mine is totally on the up and up.

256
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,020
Your beer.

257
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,940
Up from where?

258
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,280
Pays taxes, even.

259
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,120
You drink this stuff?

260
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,200
Legitimate businessman seeking dark, handsome technoguru

261
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,560
for discreet assistance in long moonlit walks.

262
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,740
I hate earth beer.

263
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,520
And like I said, this thing with your parents?

264
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,840
That's where I come in.

265
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,080
Look, the last time I tried to help you, I had half the…

266
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,880
The beer gets better after a few sips, Kamal.

267
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,600
I promise.

268
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,620
And you know what?

269
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,020
It's all you've got.

270
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,440
Why do you keep asking me?

271
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,420
Does Sophia talk about my…

272
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,460
Drink the beer, Kamal.

273
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,560
Let's go.

274
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,460
What kind of business?

275
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,820
Ronnie, what's going on there?

276
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,100
The sweet sounds of Corner Boy and his refugee bride finding domestic bliss.

277
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,720
Oh.

278
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,680
And they always fight when it gets hot.

279
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,420
And it's hot in Boston.

280
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,140
How's it in Kentucky?

281
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,240
Oh, it's hot, but it's a lot quieter.

282
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,000
Ronnie, you gotta move.

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,020
What if I could afford to?

284
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,900
I had the weirdest couple of days.

285
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,420
My country wants me to be a spy.

286
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,520
A spy?

287
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,740
First, I got recruited by Professor Avi.

288
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,320
You remember me talking about him, cultural anthropology.

289
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,460
Oh yeah, the one you thought was a spook.

290
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,040
He wears a service ring.

291
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,300
He only started teaching about ten years ago,

292
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,120
which means he could have done twenty and out.

293
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,460
And one day, a couple of kids were talking about buying a car.

294
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,020
Every model they mentioned,

295
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,960
he knew how long it would float.

296
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,740
How long it would float?

297
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,440
If you ran it off a bridge.

298
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,280
Okay, that is a little strange, but that doesn't make him a spy.

299
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,300
What, just really, really weird?

300
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,140
You think everybody has a secret life.

301
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,120
Everybody does.

302
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,120
I don't.

303
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,780
The reservoir.

304
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,920
Jesus H, Ronnie, how do you know that?

305
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,200
Were you checking up on me?

306
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,120
No.

307
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,440
You had a new state park pass sticker on your vehicle.

308
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,200
Your wet clothes in the laundry room smelled like pond water.

309
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,540
You suddenly hated John Lee Peacock.

310
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,020
And you gave up your virginity to Jason that weekend.

311
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,420
I hate you.

312
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,000
You should be a spy.

313
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,460
So the guy with the spiky hair says,

314
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,240
Can I walk you home?

315
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,920
See what real people wear?

316
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,760
You idiot.

317
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,860
And this is like two days after Professor Avi said I should send my resume to Virginia.

318
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,560
I can't believe you, Ronnie.

319
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,660
I'd have been too scared to notice anything.

320
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,500
No.

321
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
This guy, you'd have noticed.

322
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,420
Hey, it sounds like your neighbors have stopped fighting.

323
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,480
Oh God.

324
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,200
That means they're gonna make up.

325
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,900
That's bad.

326
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,640
Their headboard is right against the wall of my bedroom.

327
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,200
Gotcha.

328
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,380
Oh, that reminds me.

329
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,720
Mom said to tell you she heard about the guy

330
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,680
who's posing as a flower delivery man

331
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,500
and attacking women in their apartment.

332
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,360
Not to open my door.

333
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,940
Anyway, I don't have to take the spy job, thank God.

334
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,480
I got something better.

335
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,500
Oh my God, Ronnie, that's great.

336
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,360
Mmm, not so great.

337
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,500
It's this kid, he's starting a business.

338
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,140
He has a printer fabricator.

339
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,400
Pardon me, miss.

340
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:00,960
Excuse me?

341
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,820
You dropped something.

342
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,380
Hey!

343
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:03,800
What are you…

344
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,660
What are you…

345
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,780
Let go!

346
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,340
Don't scream!

347
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,500
Don't make a sound!

348
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,440
I…

349
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,820
I…

350
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,600
I'll grab all this.

351
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,740
Hey, stud!

352
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,120
How about some flowers first?

353
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,980
Screw you!

354
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,980
Myself, I like a box of chocolates

355
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,580
and a man who's not afraid to cry.

356
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,140
You're not afraid to cry, are you, Jean?

357
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,720
Who the hell are you?

358
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,940
Shut up!

359
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,640
See, there's just no chemistry here.

360
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,660
It's time to let her go, Jean.

361
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,880
Look, they said I need a girl for this thing.

362
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,980
Is this another test?

363
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,580
Oh, it's not.

364
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,320
It's like the bonus round, stud.

365
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,680
Let her go, dance with me.

366
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,020
What?

367
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,780
Don't you like what you see?

368
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,060
Please, no!

369
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,640
I am at my best in the bonus round, Jean.

370
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,480
Thank you.

371
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,020
There's your consolation.

372
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,040
Oh, God!

373
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,080
I know.

374
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,860
I know, it's over now.

375
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,920
Get on home.

376
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,640
Thank you.

377
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,520
I'll finish up with Mr.

378
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,620
Congeniality.

379
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,260
That was real nice, what you did for that lady.

380
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,580
Not real smart, but nice.

381
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,780
I'm working on a merit badge.

382
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,280
Okay, sweetie.

383
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,120
What's gonna happen here is gonna happen.

384
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,440
So just relax.

385
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,480
If it makes it any easier, it's nothing personal, okay?

386
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,980
Nothing personal.

387
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,480
Just business.

388
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,460
I don't know.

389
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,020
I might have to make it personal.

390
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,920
Your funeral.

391
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,620
Okay, Angel.

392
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,080
Time for you to meet the big dog.

393
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,860
See, the problem with being a big dog

394
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,660
is there's always a bigger dog.

395
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,180
Damn, you're gonna want to put some ice on that.

396
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,180
You got quick feet.

397
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,820
All those years of ballet.

398
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,160
You gonna go get that knife?

399
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,220
You know, there's people watching, you know.

400
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,800
I'll make sure I do this thing.

401
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,860
And they're gonna see everything.

402
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,960
I can see why you get your dates at gunpoint.

403
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,920
I just thought you should know.

404
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,140
Come on, Jean.

405
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,680
Skip the knife.

406
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,320
Go for the M6 under your jacket.

407
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,540
Come on, baby.

408
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,620
Give it to me.

409
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,180
Oh, did I get that right?

410
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,260
You draw the gun, I slap you around,

411
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,760
then the face dip into the sidewalk, or…

412
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,540
Or did you want to lead?

413
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:21,880
Jesus!

414
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,500
I like to dance.

415
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,700
Oh, you just bought yourself a bullet in the back, bitch!

416
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,060
Oh, only the guy with the sniper rifle

417
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,740
across the street has two broken arms.

418
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,140
Pete?

419
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,880
And the girl with the ponytail?

420
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,080
The one who was supposed to cover you from the roof?

421
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:43,780
Marty?

422
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,860
What the hell is that?

423
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,720
Her hair?

424
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,340
You cut off her hair?

425
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,900
It's just you and me.

426
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,200
Lover.

427
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,320
All right, get up.

428
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,600
Get up.

429
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,220
Now, from the top, and remember, posture counts.

430
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,620
There's the gun.

431
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,440
Pick it up.

432
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,840
Come on, big dog.

433
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,320
Let's go again.

434
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,200
This time you're…

435
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,420
And here we are again.

436
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,440
Christ!

437
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,620
Oh, the choreography is there,

438
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,820
but I'm not feeling it yet the way I want to.

439
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,480
Screw you!

440
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,060
All right, on your feet, Jean.

441
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,020
I'm just gonna put the gun in your hand this time.

442
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,160
That's it.

443
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,560
Yeah, get your finger nice and comfy right on the trigger.

444
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,240
Come on, big dog.

445
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,260
Bring it, baby.

446
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,740
Die, bitch!

447
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,580
The trouble with where your head is, Jean.

448
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,500
Mind if I call you Jean?

449
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,900
You shot my toe off!

450
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,900
This little piggy went wee-wee-wee all the way.

451
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,740
Oh, am I hurting your feelings?

452
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,420
You see, the trouble with being bad, Jean,

453
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,840
is you only last as long as you're the scariest pup on the block.

454
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,420
Sin is gonna do you, freak!

455
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,780
And no matter how bad you are,

456
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,860
how tough,

457
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,340
how fast,

458
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,900
you know what's waiting for you, big dog?

459
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,520
Oh, Christ!

460
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,740
A bigger bitch.

461
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,120
Shut it off.

462
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,580
So I've got some interesting stuff on Jean.

463
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,140
You can't do things like that, Durga.

464
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,060
He's an auditor.

465
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,420
Everybody hates auditors.

466
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,180
I looked it up.

467
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,400
That was insane.

468
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,180
The cops, they're gonna go crazy trying to figure out what happened.

469
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,680
They're gonna trace it back and probably…

470
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,920
…

471
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,160
some likely suspects who hate George Shibura.

472
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,720
Some blind accounts and dead ends.

473
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,500
I don't care!

474
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,280
I don't want anything like that ever happening again.

475
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
Do you understand?

476
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,640
Jersey, I am not a child.

477
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,720
I am not a toy.

478
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,340
And I am not your thing.

479
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,200
I was very restrained with George.

480
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,860
I didn't cook him, I didn't send him to jail.

481
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,880
But people who mess with us,

482
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,620
they're going to get stung.

483
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,200
Us?

484
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,760
Yes, us.

485
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,260
Team Jersey.

486
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,440
Why not Team Durga?

487
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,740
Because I said so.

488
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,440
Okay.

489
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,700
So…

490
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,980
do we have cheerleaders?

491
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,700
Welcome to the tastefully appointed security control room.

492
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,700
The nerve center, if you will, at the Apollonian Temple Casino.

493
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,100
My name is Aidan Maki.

494
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,600
Cut that crap, Aidan.

495
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,640
And I'll be your in-flight host this evening.

496
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,020
We want on monitors 3, 11 and 16.

497
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,800
So remind me again, why can't we break these bastards' knees

498
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,560
and drop them in the canal for the freaking sewer crabs today?

499
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:02,980
Mr.

500
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,560
F, it just makes your business,

501
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,200
your totally legitimate tax-paying business,

502
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,260
look bad when college kids start turning up all dead and everything.

503
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,680
Aidan!

504
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,020
I'm always going to take care of this situation.

505
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,500
Aidan!

506
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,360
What?

507
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,380
I'm not doing this.

508
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,200
Not doing what?

509
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,580
I'm not doing anything involving kneecaps or canals or…

510
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,860
This is touching.

511
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
…

512
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,640
decomposing bodies!

513
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Excuse us, Mr.

514
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,120
F.

515
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,040
All the man wants to find out is what they're doing.

516
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,940
So he can what, write his memoirs?

517
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,060
You said this was all legal.

518
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,980
I haven't asked you to do anything illegal, have I?

519
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,100
Didn't you just hear what he said?

520
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,200
But the whole killing thing will only happen if you don't help.

521
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,980
And even that's worst-case scenario.

522
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,580
Actually, that wouldn't be the worst case.

523
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,020
The worst case would be…

524
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

525
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,260
Just hear me out, Kamal.

526
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,060
Mr.

527
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,100
F shows you what they're doing and you tell him how they're doing it.

528
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,860
Okay, but no kneecaps, right?

529
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,660
No canals, just explanations.

530
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,240
Mr.

531
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,620
F, explanations are nice.

532
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,260
And if I do this, I want visas.

533
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,720
No more happy talk.

534
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,180
I want my family on their way here and I want it now.

535
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,140
Phew, you drive a hard bargain, my friend.

536
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,820
Cut the crap, Aiden.

537
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,280
Okay, from here we can monitor the whole casino floor.

538
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,860
See the blackjack tables here?

539
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,500
There's six of them in each pit.

540
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,560
And the managers rotate the dealers every twenty minutes.

541
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,460
The five people highlighted here are counting cards.

542
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,580
How do you know they're counting cards?

543
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,180
Because they win too much.

544
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,880
The question is how are they cheating?

545
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,640
They don't stay at the same table.

546
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,100
They don't move around in any predictable pattern.

547
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,120
We could just take them off the table and leave them in a ditch.

548
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,940
Why did you say we shouldn't do that again?

549
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,640
But it would really be better if they understood how they were screwing me.

550
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,040
Right.

551
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,460
We got archives of all their plays the last ten days.

552
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,600
Figure out how they're screwing me.

553
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,540
What do you say?

554
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,900
Figure it out, please.

555
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,260
I think he was talking to me.

556
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,540
See this number?

557
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,540
That's how much we figure these kids have taken out of the casino.

558
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,080
You get it back from me?

559
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,760
Twenty percent of it's yours.

560
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,140
Oh, wow.

561
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:58,980
Trust me.

562
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,820
If all these guys lose is their money, you'll be doing them a huge favor.

563
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,860
Trust him.

564
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,040
Whoa, check out table nine.

565
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,000
Camera's looking right down her dress.

566
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,820
Were you ever on reach?

567
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,680
No, sir.

568
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,080
You have me scheduled for a duty rotation, leaving for reach December 15.

569
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,080
Right.

570
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,540
Sir, have I somehow not performed to your requirements?

571
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,540
What?

572
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,940
Oh, no, boy.

573
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,180
I'm sending you to the labyrinth.

574
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,120
Oni's workshop is on reach, where Oni elves build their toy soldiers.

575
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,460
Sir?

576
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,680
The place where children are the toys.

577
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,300
That's where the Spartan 2.

578
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,180
0s are from.

579
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,260
All Dr.

580
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,740
Halsey's pretty ones.

581
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,340
Oh, I see, sir.

582
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,300
Where, if you see anything, you must not contact me.

583
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,900
Of course.

584
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,200
Since for the six months of your rotation there, you will not be working for me.

585
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,200
Of course.

586
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,480
And would never let your loyalties to us, to human decency, to the protection of standards, interfere with your work.

587
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,720
Oh, yes, sir.

588
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,940
Look at it this way.

589
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,400
It's probably the safest place in human inhabited space.

590
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,340
How's your history?

591
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,720
Well, fair, sir.

592
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
How are you on World War II?

593
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,700
Cressy.

594
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,020
English longbow against French feudal cavalry.

595
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,180
Bloodbath, sir.

596
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,100
Very good.

597
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,900
Except, that was the Hundred Years War.

598
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,320
World War II was 500 years later.

599
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,060
I always get them mixed up.

600
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,840
30 years war and 100 years war and…

601
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,100
The Germans were winning.

602
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,520
They used an elaborate encryption scheme.

603
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,480
The British cracked it and then they had a problem.

604
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,540
After they cracked the code.

605
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,220
That's right.

606
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,920
Now the Brits knew what the Germans meant to do.

607
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,520
But if they acted on that knowledge…

608
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,760
The Germans would realize the code had been broken.

609
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,280
And what would you do if someone had cracked your code?

610
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,300
I'd make a new one.

611
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,460
Full marks.

612
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,300
Thank you, sir.

613
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,880
So they had to do a terrible calculus.

614
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:02,800
They had to decide how much they could use the intelligence and how many times they would just have to stand there and watch a German operation they knew they could have stopped.

615
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,840
A dilemma worthy of Solomon, sir.

616
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:05,820
Yes.

617
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,540
Have you been thinking about Harmony?

618
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,440
Yes, sir.

619
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,360
Oh.

620
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,660
Oh my god.

621
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,540
You mean Troy and Harmony?

622
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,740
I don't know.

623
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,800
I'm stuck in a dusty old office and no one tells me anything.

624
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,860
Hello and welcome to Hot in Cold.

625
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,040
Please place your thumb on the transaction plate.

626
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,880
Bev, it's like you're here every time I come by.

627
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,760
Isn't that crazy?

628
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,440
Thank you.

629
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,500
I'm afraid I don't know the answer to your question.

630
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,480
What beverage can I offer you?

631
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,000
Coffee, black, two sugars.

632
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,880
Gladly, Miss James.

633
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,980
Oh, Bev, I don't know how to tell you this.

634
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,640
The other day it was late.

635
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,000
It was just me in here with the canning machine and I was a little tipsy and…

636
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,960
Oh Bev, I'm so sorry.

637
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,840
It didn't mean anything.

638
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,640
It was just snacks.

639
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,200
Can you ever forgive me?

640
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,140
Thank you.

641
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,180
I'm afraid I don't know the answer to your question.

642
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,100
Enjoy your beverage.

643
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,160
Hi there.

644
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,740
I wanted to say thanks.

645
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,600
For what?

646
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,480
Well, you know, the thing you did.

647
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,180
Buddy, I've never seen you before in my life.

648
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,220
Capiche, we never met, no time.

649
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,480
I'd stay away from the creamer in this place.

650
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,960
100% real dried animal fat.

651
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,480
Ugh.

652
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,040
Well, just so you know, things really pissed.

653
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,520
I mean, they could say witch animal.

654
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,180
Even goat would be okay.

655
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,600
Right now I'm imagining someone noking those big black apartment squirrels.

656
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,180
I know you can take care of yourself, but…

657
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,060
I mean, it was great what you did, but watch your back.

658
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,900
Finn is really pissed.

659
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,380
You think I should send a card and some flowers?

660
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,720
This is where you work?

661
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,060
A lot of people work with A.

662
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,140
I.

663
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,360
This is where you live?

664
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,640
Ooh, I think something died over here.

665
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,300
That smell?

666
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,320
I think it's the curtains.

667
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,460
Someone spilled milk on them.

668
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,440
On the curtains?

669
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,140
There's the printer fabricator.

670
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,460
It's a desktop model.

671
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,120
Yeah?

672
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,720
I thought you were going to do manufacturing.

673
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,360
I am.

674
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,260
I mean, we are.

675
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,900
Small things.

676
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,680
Look, here's a spec sheet for our product.

677
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,480
What do you think?

678
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,540
It's a plastic kitten.

679
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,100
Aha!

680
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,100
It's a disposable chatter that looks like a plastic kitten.

681
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,900
Like a chatter you'd get in a quickie store?

682
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,520
Right.

683
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,480
See, I can fabricate them and sell them to the Refuse.

684
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,420
The what?

685
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,320
Refuse.

686
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,320
Refugees.

687
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,740
They can't afford a real service.

688
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
Your fabricator can't make these?

689
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,180
Can't?

690
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,400
Not so much.

691
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,760
They're too thick.

692
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,280
This is a desktop.

693
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,420
But they said I could use a fabricator like this.

694
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,780
That was so mean of them, wasn't it?

695
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,620
My uncle has a print fab shop.

696
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:54,280
If you take the carriage arm off and use electrostatic polymer, you might get it to run.

697
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,260
But who knows how long it would last?

698
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,020
You're a genius.

699
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,900
Let's try it.

700
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,600
Thanks for the ride.

701
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,440
No problem.

702
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,620
Aiden gets these business emergencies sometimes.

703
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,700
I'm exhausted.

704
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,360
Did I see a new chatter tonight?

705
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,900
Yeah, I won it in a raffle.

706
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,260
It's fine, too.

707
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,800
It makes my old one look like a payphone.

708
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,560
A payphone?

709
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,180
Ancient piece of crappy hardware.

710
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,020
Half of them wouldn't even take incoming calls.

711
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,640
No GPS.

712
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,260
Never mind.

713
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,160
Aiden was getting a little worried.

714
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,180
He promised Freyhoff he'd figure out what those guys were doing, but he was beginning to have doubts.

715
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,440
Oh, the casino.

716
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,080
Yeah.

717
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,900
This pack of grad students from Stanford is working a private CP channel, subvocalizing through KKI uvular implants.

718
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,380
Ooh, uvular implants.

719
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,180
He's not even counting the cards himself.

720
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,060
He's got a tally running on a corneal…

721
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,740
But you really don't care, do you?

722
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,600
Uh-uh.

723
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,420
What you think looks better on me?

724
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,480
Slingbacks or Turkish flats?

725
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,220
What?

726
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,580
I bet Aiden a new pair of shoes that you would figure the casino thing out.

727
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,860
You bet Aiden a new pair of shoes?

728
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,960
Don't get indignant.

729
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,820
I'm letting you pick the shoes.

730
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,740
God, Aiden and his business.

731
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,980
If I were him, I wouldn't give a damn about any business emergencies when I could be with you instead.

732
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,620
Come on.

733
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,740
Slingbacks.

734
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
Definitely slingbacks.

735
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,060
Those are the ones with buckles, right?

736
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,020
There was no business emergency.

737
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,460
What?

738
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,300
God, you are so dense sometimes.

739
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,300
I don't understand.

740
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,660
He had me drive you home because he knows you like that.

741
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,800
Aiden likes to keep his people happy.

742
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,160
Do the shoes make you happy?

743
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,220
The jewelry?

744
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,680
Mostly, Aiden makes me happy.

745
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,680
As for the rest of it, I've been poor, you know.

746
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,700
There's no glamour in waiting tables.

747
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,540
Okay.

748
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,300
What?

749
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,380
All things being equal, life is better when you're not broke.

750
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,920
I was just figuring that out.

751
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,860
Trevor, what do you suppose it's doing?

752
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,160
I don't know.

753
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,880
I think maybe it's just slow.

754
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,040
My uncle's quite bad, so I don't make this noise.

755
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,840
Well, Ronnie, this one's not right here.

756
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,500
I guess not.

757
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,340
Look, Ronnie, you work for me, okay?

758
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,160
So I'd appreciate it if you didn't question every decision I make, alright?

759
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,520
So, do you want to be sitting in the room?

760
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,020
That's better with you.

761
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,720
Ronnie's good.

762
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,260
Look at that.

763
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,380
Don't they look great?

764
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,360
Well, they are cute.

765
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,040
We make a great team, Ronnie.

766
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,580
Trevor, there's no team here.

767
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,060
We made 49 cheap chatters before your fabricator exploded.

768
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,000
Shaped like kittens?

769
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,000
Girls will love them.

770
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,520
I need a job.

771
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,600
You need to relocate back to reality.

772
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,400
We'll get another print fab and make them for what?

773
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,000
7% of what a cheap chatter costs in a convenience store?

774
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,560
We'll clear a good chunk of change.

775
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,260
Your 15% will bring you a-

776
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,960
My 15%?

777
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,060
In addition to my salary?

778
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,680
Well, not exactly.

779
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,140
I mean, all my capital's tied up in the chatters.

780
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,100
But this is better.

781
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,540
15% of what we net- I mean, 25%.

782
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,440
25%, Ronnie.

783
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,820
You can be a partner.

784
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,160
Forget working for me.

785
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,120
50%.

786
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,280
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie, don't shake your head.

787
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,800
Besides, I can't afford to pay you.

788
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,840
Not until we sell some kittens.

789
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,100
So, I took 14 disposable chatters as payment and scrammed.

790
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,580
What are you gonna do with 14 chatters?

791
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,280
Shaped like little purple kittens.

792
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,240
Right.

793
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,520
Shaped like kittens.

794
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,740
Oh, hold on.

795
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,820
They're good for 400 hours.

796
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
They make great gifts.

797
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,060
Yeah, got any not so girly?

798
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,920
Maybe shaped like a cobra?

799
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:27,880
No.

800
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:28,840
Wolf?

801
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,820
No.

802
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,680
Cow, even?

803
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
Just kittens.

804
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,500
Yeah, okay.

805
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,020
I'll take two.

806
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,400
Thanks.

807
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,320
I'm back.

808
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,220
I'm selling them at a flea market.

809
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:49,340
So, I guess I'm gonna get fitted for an all-black suit and commissary shoes.

810
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,160
You are gonna be a spy.

811
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,280
They give you pens with knockout gas in them.

812
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,560
Now, what girl doesn't need a pen with knockout gas?

813
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,500
Particularly in the big city.

814
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Where guys pretending to deliver flowers-

815
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,720
Knock on in his and women's doors.

816
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,780
Oh, give your mama a hug for me.
