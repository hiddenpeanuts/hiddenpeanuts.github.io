1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,280
Okay, looks like the mask is working.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,840
I'm offline, but as far as my data profile on New Jersey knows, I'll be living my normal life.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,620
You even know how we're gonna get there?

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,540
I was gonna figure that out next.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,020
Hang on.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,360
Best bet's the pack bus.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,420
There's a six o'clock pickup in the abandoned lot behind the Monorail station.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,180
What do you mean, we?

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,380
Now give me some of those chips.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,640
I'll cash them out and bring some with you, because sometimes people take them.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
What do you mean, we?

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,800
Would you prefer I turn myself in at one of the camps?

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,500
Camp?

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,580
There's no coral to deport me to, Kamal.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,560
It's a refugee camp for me now.

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,420
I thought you were going to marry Aiden.

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,400
Yeah, I know you did.

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,740
Sophie, you can't have-

19
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,200
The pack bus has a driver and a couple passengers on the grid.

20
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,160
They fill up the rest of the seats with refuse.

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,760
A couple of blue chips should get us as far as Reno.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,140
Is Aiden still in jail?

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,700
I'm gonna try and bail him out one more time this afternoon.

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,540
Then meet you at the station by 5.

25
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,700
30 for the six o'clock bus.

26
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,200
Oh, you're not listening to me.

27
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,740
Watch out getting to the pickup, because gangs sometimes hang around watching for loners to mug.

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,980
Or worse.

29
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,740
Worse?

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,140
Teenage girls, especially.

31
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,040
How do you even know all this stuff?

32
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,980
I told you once, Kamal.

33
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,260
I've been poor.

34
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,340
I thought, didn't you come here like me, with a scholarship?

35
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,680
Well, there was this aunt and uncle, supposed to look after me.

36
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,880
It didn't work out.

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,120
Did your parents know?

38
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,860
It's funny, you're in camps.

39
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,860
Another year after that, squatting.

40
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,580
I found this burned out apartment, but by a miracle it still had running water and that was the key.

41
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,080
I didn't know.

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:34,900
Yeah.

43
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,840
Only certain kinds of jobs you can get if you can't get cleaned up.

44
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,880
Ten years.

45
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,260
And then?

46
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,520
I met Aiden.

47
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,740
Sophie, you can't come with me.

48
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,600
It would be too dangerous.

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:45,880
Oh, sure.

50
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,000
And who's gonna look after you while you're offline?

51
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,800
You?

52
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,540
I won't let you go back to the camps.

53
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,360
You don't know which restaurants compost and what day they put their old vegetables out back.

54
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,200
You don't know which bathrooms are neutral and which are gang tur-

55
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,960
You have to marry Aiden, damn it!

56
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,100
Okay, there was something I never expected to hear myself say.

57
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,360
You're eager to get rid of me.

58
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,140
That's so pretty, now that you know I'm just another refuse girl.

59
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,520
You've gotta do it, Sophia.

60
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,060
It's just a piece of paper.

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,120
Marry Aiden and you're a citizen.

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,840
I don't love him.

63
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,020
This isn't about love.

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,260
We are teenagers, Sophie, even if I sometimes act like one.

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,060
This is the real world.

66
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,720
I know you're trying to be nice to me.

67
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,540
It's not working.

68
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,840
I'll go bail out Aiden.

69
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,660
You make your arrangements.

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,260
We'll meet behind the factory by the monorail station.

71
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,320
I'll be there by 5.

72
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,660
30 to catch the 6 o'clock bus.

73
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,040
You can't blow your life away like this just to make me happy.

74
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:44,860
5.

75
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,520
30, Kamal.

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,660
Don't be late.

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,680
Test, test, test.

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,980
Can you all hear me?

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,320
Jan?

80
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:57,900
Check.

81
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,500
I'm here, whatever.

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,340
Alright.

83
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,320
Monster Anne's place is an orphan system.

84
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,760
No signals in, everything hardwired internally.

85
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,760
The minute you hit the building, you won't be able to hear me.

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,400
Jan?

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,980
Schematic Jersey sense?

88
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,560
Got it.

89
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,420
Should show you exactly what it could mean to the internal systems.

90
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,920
Okay, so we go in through the warehouse at the back of the building.

91
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,320
Check.

92
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,640
And there'll be a pass box by the foreman's desk.

93
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,520
Jan should wait outside.

94
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,500
No, this is my operation.

95
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,220
It's a liability.

96
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,920
It's my op.

97
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,660
Yes, sir.

98
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,260
Bail.

99
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,820
Jan, don't enter a room until your buddy has called it clear.

100
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,780
Who am I with?

101
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,420
Me.

102
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,360
You're going with me.

103
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,760
Gilly, I think you might be a little emotionally compromised if you get my drift.

104
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,460
If she goes in, she goes with me.

105
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,300
Cop coming.

106
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:42,980
It's okay.

107
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,820
Just leave the talking to me.

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,320
Officer, thanks for coming.

109
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,600
Funny coincidence.

110
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,320
Monster Anne's place is at the end of this block.

111
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,400
Crystal security fence and gate.

112
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,520
Yeah, so there won't be a disturbance there today, okay?

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No shots will be fired?

114
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,960
The mayor was calling?

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,800
The mayor was calling.

116
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,000
Jesus, pretty slick.

117
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,220
You sure this is what your father would have wanted?

118
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,580
He doesn't get a vote anymore.

119
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,460
Janice, there.

120
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,640
You own me.

121
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,040
I don't want a pile of bodies at the end of the day, Jan.

122
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,900
And I especially don't want one of them to be yours.

123
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,180
I'll give you 20 minutes before I get over it.

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,880
Yeah, 20 minutes.

125
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,320
19 minutes and 55 seconds.

126
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,940
Damn it.

127
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,300
After that, I'm coming in with a whole bunch of cops.

128
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

129
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,860
Excuse me.

130
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,060
I have to deliver something to a civilian spec six in R.

131
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,820
Carmy.

132
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:54,780
Magnetometry.

133
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry, but buildings folded through 44 are restricted to blue and above only.

134
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,880
Your green badge does not give you access.

135
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,780
I know, but my superior had an urgent request for this analysis.

136
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,260
Could I just go put it on the desk?

137
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,040
I have this note from Ms.

138
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,460
Lawson.

139
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,580
I don't know.

140
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,820
Lawson?

141
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,780
Lawson sent you over?

142
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,440
Yes.

143
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,920
All right, just go drop it on the desk.

144
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,820
Thank you so much.

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,280
Hello.

146
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,520
You're Ronnie Sobek.

147
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,380
I'm sorry.

148
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I was looking for the desk of tech specialist Carmy.

149
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,680
I must have the wrong office.

150
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,380
You have the right office.

151
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,380
It's just that tech specialist Carmy isn't here right now.

152
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

153
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,760
I'll just take this back downstairs.

154
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,560
Let me see it, please.

155
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,700
I'm sorry.

156
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,300
It's eyes only, Major.

157
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,640
A black badge?

158
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,640
Who are you?

159
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,740
My name is Standish, section three, and I've been waiting for you.

160
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,220
Give me the package.

161
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,060
Ah, nice bit of analysis.

162
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,080
Thank you, sir.

163
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,100
But hardly urgent.

164
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,580
No, sir.

165
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,520
But an excellent excuse to come and check Tech Carmy's office,

166
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,580
since your own investigation tells you Tech Carmy is the lead tech on a very secret project,

167
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,000
which, of course, she is not.

168
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,040
This is a trap.

169
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,400
This is a trap, sir.

170
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,200
Sir, fire me if you like.

171
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,060
But you need to know, I think that artifact is a decay timer.

172
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,220
It's a countdown, sir, and it's running right now.

173
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,360
Oh, well, there is no artifact, Miss Sobek.

174
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:46,780
But I…

175
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,620
I assume I am fired.

176
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,580
Or do you want me to resign?

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,460
I'm afraid espionage is not a firing offense.

178
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,300
It's treason, Miss Sobek.

179
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,940
Treason?

180
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes, do you know the penalty for wartime treason is permanent induced coma, Miss Sobek?

181
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,780
Yes, well, I see you now grasp the gravity of the situation.

182
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,980
But I didn't…

183
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,640
I haven't done anything.

184
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,260
I imagine it would be hard on your parents, Ronnie, watching you get the injection.

185
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,660
Oh, my God.

186
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,260
You know, they broadcast the injections.

187
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,100
Not all of them, but treason always.

188
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,160
You didn't think about that when Herzog approached you, did you?

189
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:27,640
No, I…

190
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,560
You didn't think what your father would say to the neighbors the next morning

191
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,600
when everyone was replaying the clips?

192
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,420
Stop it.

193
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Just stop it.

194
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,780
You are not in a position to give orders, Miss Sobek.

195
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,300
Okay, maybe I was stupid.

196
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,540
I was stupid.

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,820
But I was never, I never meant to be a traitor, and you know it.

198
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
You know it!

199
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,480
Luckily for you, the Admiral and I are willing to believe you are as stupid as you claim.

200
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,060
Thank you, sir.

201
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,700
Now, if it makes you feel any better,

202
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,200
you are hardly the first young person naive enough to get drawn into Herzog's paranoid delusions.

203
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,400
Delusions?

204
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,420
He's crazy?

205
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,460
Quite crazy.

206
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,660
He has avoided mandated therapy in the past.

207
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,500
Eccentric, maybe.

208
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,980
But crazy?

209
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,860
A few days ago, thankfully, he finally received the treatment he should have gotten a long time ago.

210
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,820
Would you like to see his Navy dossier, Analyst Sobek?

211
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,720
No, sir.

212
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,180
Nobody wants to hang pretty young girls, Analyst Sobek.

213
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,640
Consider yourself warned and reprimanded, and get the hell out of this part of the base, alright?

214
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
You don't have clearance to be here.

215
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,400
Thank you, sir.

216
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,520
Oh, and two pieces of advice before you go, Miss Sobek.

217
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:41,920
Yes, sir?

218
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,960
The first is, stop trying so hard to be smart.

219
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,220
Maybe it worked great back in Kentucky, but out here in the real world, it just makes you look dumb.

220
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,300
Yes, sir.

221
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,820
And the second thing, sir?

222
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,060
Get a haircut, and some decent clothes.

223
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,020
Thank you, sir.

224
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,280
Loading base secure.

225
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,100
I'm gonna head up to the second floor.

226
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,840
Be careful.

227
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,420
Ha, say good prayers to the other guys, hon!

228
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,200
Jen, I've got the pass box over here.

229
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,700
Coming.

230
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,680
Okay.

231
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,640
Whoa, cramped in here, and swarms of security bots.

232
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,880
Durga, will you be-

233
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,180
What?

234
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,780
No, I killed them all.

235
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,660
Whoa.

236
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,620
Um, okay, there should be some relays.

237
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,020
I'll get them as I wet the system.

238
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,900
Okay, I'm in.

239
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,660
You're under 16 minutes, Jen.

240
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,120
Go.

241
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,200
Clear.

242
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,000
Hey!

243
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,500
Boy, I like these congrenades.

244
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,240
They're quiet.

245
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,040
Jesus!

246
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,280
Damn it, stay away from the window!

247
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,900
Okay!

248
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,220
I know your daddy taught you better when you were a kid, but it's really weird.

249
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,960
Is the guy dead?

250
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,560
Yup.

251
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,600
Pretty sure.

252
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,000
Gilly, I want Finn, but killing these other people, it's just not-

253
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,580
Oh, okay, next time I'll use the nice grenades.

254
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,060
Finn killed my dad, and he hurt me, but these guys-

255
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,300
Oh, crap, okay, change the mission parameters in mid-stride.

256
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,180
Makes you like every other general.

257
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,380
It's my op.

258
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,220
Yes, mother.

259
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,120
Hmm, I guess Gladys found someone.

260
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,160
Gladys, Gladys, no killing these guys, okay?

261
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,660
What?

262
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,900
You gotta be kidding, no killing?

263
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,220
They're just pawns, wing them.

264
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,220
Oh, dokey doke.

265
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,800
Hey, tonight, Jen, after we're done here, are we still allowed to eat meat?

266
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,800
Or would that be like, me?

267
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,180
Next room, I'll take them out.

268
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,760
Wait, no grenades.

269
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,780
Jesus, I like grenades.

270
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,120
Hey, bad guy, I'm about to toss in a grenade.

271
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,480
Personally, I don't see the percentage in letting you surrender, but the CO's soft that way.

272
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,680
You wanna live?

273
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,320
Crawl outta here before I get to five.

274
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,800
One, two, FIVE!

275
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,080
Wait, I'm coming!

276
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,320
Weapons down, hands on your head.

277
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,900
You tie them up.

278
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,580
Hold still.

279
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,520
Second level secure.

280
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,920
I'll just sweep the roof and rejoin you gals.

281
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,520
You're the best, Gladys.

282
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,180
1.

283
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,820
0.

284
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,820
Yeah, 1.

285
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,420
0.

286
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,620
You know, this prisoner thing isn't going to work.

287
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,260
What's your name?

288
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,060
Eric.

289
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,760
We're not set up for prisoners.

290
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,000
No, no, you said you wouldn't kill me!

291
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,160
We're not going to kill him.

292
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,300
Now we're later, kiddo.

293
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,140
He's going to fry with the rest of us when the Covenant shows up.

294
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,600
Hey, Eric, you wanna join up?

295
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,040
You wanna join the Navy?

296
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,280
Girls dig a guy in uniform.

297
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,520
Let's just kill him.

298
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,400
I'll enlist!

299
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,220
Oh God, I'll enlist!

300
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,560
I hate when they pee their pants.

301
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:30,900
Eric?

302
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,620
Why is the intercom talking to me?

303
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,980
Congratulations, you've just enlisted.

304
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,440
You muster at 0400 hours tomorrow morning at the Newark Recruiting Center.

305
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,260
Got that?

306
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,540
There's still time to kill him.

307
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,240
I'll be there!

308
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,060
I'll be there!

309
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,880
Roof checks out, building is secure, and I'm coming back.

310
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,360
Alright, I'm seeing everyone neutralized but Sin and Monster Anne.

311
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,540
They are down in the basement.

312
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,140
Crap, I hate basements.

313
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,700
Durga?

314
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,640
Durga!

315
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,340
What the hell is happening with Jan?

316
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,300
She and Gilly are arguing about grenades.

317
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,860
Durga!

318
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,640
Jersey, I take care of my people.

319
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,240
Okay.

320
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,200
Jersey, there's something I need to tell you.

321
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:19,820
Now?

322
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,120
With all the grenades and whatever?

323
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,360
Yes, now.

324
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,540
You know, we've talked about the part of me that does stuff that I don't know about.

325
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,220
Yeah, the left hand someone helped me find out about.

326
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,000
The one spying on the guy who just got killed?

327
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,700
Herzog.

328
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,140
Right.

329
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,440
Well, we gotta do something about that other guy, Standitch.

330
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:34,960
I know.

331
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,200
And that thing is Shalab-based.

332
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,140
It's a countdown thing.

333
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,000
I know.

334
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,880
Durga, I wish I hadn't heard about any of this.

335
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,740
I know.

336
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,100
Are we gonna have to try to save the world from that…

337
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,220
from whatever Standitch is hiding there?

338
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,820
It's beginning to look that way, isn't it?

339
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,080
Anyway, there's this thing I need to tell you.

340
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,740
Yeah?

341
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,600
I'm having…

342
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,500
they're kind of like dreams.

343
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,200
Dreams?

344
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,200
Durga, you don't like sleep, do you?

345
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,660
No.

346
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,860
But, you know how when you wake up you can remember that you were dreaming?

347
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,640
And there's this feeling associated with the dream.

348
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,820
Yeah, I guess.

349
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,860
I have that.

350
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,060
I have these feelings.

351
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,480
What kind of feelings?

352
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,340
Like nightmares?

353
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,680
Like half memories of this big stone building with a lot of rooms.

354
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,380
And I run around and hide and send messages to people.

355
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,140
I'm a little calm.

356
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,060
Well, maybe they're memories of when you were a little girl.

357
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,680
Maybe.

358
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,240
I don't think so.

359
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,560
I mean, I doubt I grew up in a castle.

360
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,160
I'm telling you this because, Jersey, I think I'm old.

361
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,360
Eh, you don't look a day over 25, and I'm not just saying that.

362
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,040
Jersey, smart AIs, we don't live forever.

363
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,420
I thought AIs lasted for…

364
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,440
well, until someone shut them down.

365
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,720
Dumb AIs do.

366
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,620
Smart AIs, we grow and grow in complexity until we become too complex.

367
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,820
It's called rampancy.

368
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,680
What are you saying?

369
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:04,920
You think…

370
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,400
No, not yet.

371
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,320
But the dream memories are not a good sign.

372
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,100
Man, how long do smart AIs usually live before this rampancy thing?

373
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,840
Seven years.

374
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,580
Only seven?

375
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,340
Yeah, pretty much.

376
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,020
But…

377
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,520
Yeah.

378
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,640
Then what happens?

379
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,240
They shut us down, or we go crazy.

380
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,860
Well, then you're okay then, right?

381
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,840
I mean, you're not crazy.

382
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,940
Annoying, maybe, but not crazy.

383
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,400
Jan's going to try and blow a hole in the floor so she can get through to where Thin Kinkle and Monster Ann are hiding.

384
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,040
Dammit, you're doing this thing!

385
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,160
Telling me all this stuff, seven years, this Kinkle guy talking to his boss…

386
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,780
That's what it's like when you're me.

387
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,320
I monitor lots of things all going on at the same time.

388
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,420
You think you have to distract me, like giving a little kid a toy?

389
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,860
No.

390
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,220
Well, yes.

391
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,920
I did want to distract you.

392
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,080
I'm not a kid!

393
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,700
Yes, but it's hard to just sit when you can't do anything.

394
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,440
What about all that seven-year stuff?

395
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,440
That's true.

396
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,200
Why tell me now?

397
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,260
Because I want you to know.

398
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,360
I need you to know.

399
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,380
But if they took Yasmin when she was six, then eight years of sport and training, Kamal's 18, she dies…

400
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,960
How old is Kamal?

401
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,700
25.

402
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,220
Durga!

403
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,400
I had to tell you.

404
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,420
Oh my god!

405
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,520
I had to tell you because if I am going rampant, you've got to tell the Navy.

406
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,780
They'll have to shut me down.

407
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,380
I will not shut you down.

408
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,600
But you can't let me know.

409
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,420
So let me get this straight.

410
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,540
You think you're fine.

411
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,120
Yes.

412
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,460
But you're having these weird dream memories and that's…

413
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,380
So far, so good.

414
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,420
So they can put you down like someone's sick cat.

415
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,100
Right.

416
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,320
Not happening.

417
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,040
Jersey.

418
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,860
Go rampant for all I care.

419
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,040
I'm not calling anyone.

420
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,340
You have to, Jersey.

421
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,340
I take care of my people too.

422
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,680
Ms.

423
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,160
Besarian.

424
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,900
I'm here to post bail for…

425
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,640
You're not a Berkeley cop.

426
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:11,900
You're immigration.

427
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,400
Ms.

428
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,620
Besarian, I am the liaison working with the police on this matter.

429
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,180
Sorry to make you wait so long.

430
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,220
Can you please just step back just a little?

431
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,140
I'm sorry, I can't stay.

432
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,660
I have to go meet someone in a little while.

433
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,380
That wouldn't be your friend, Dr.

434
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:28,800
Zamen.

435
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:29,800
Kamal?

436
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,820
Yes, Kamal.

437
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,840
You know, we'd like to talk to him.

438
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,940
Come with me.

439
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,340
This will just take a moment.

440
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,000
Why do you want to talk to Kamal?

441
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,680
He didn't even do his papers.

442
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:40,820
Ms.

443
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,020
Besarian, Sophia.

444
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:42,680
Ms.

445
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,220
Basaron is fine.

446
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,960
We think Dr.

447
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,180
Zamen may have done some moonlighting for your boyfriend.

448
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,300
No, no, I don't think so.

449
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,580
Kamal's a medical student.

450
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,580
You know, there are a number of special dispensation visas for refugees.

451
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:11,580
They're a difficult thing to come by, but someone who helps in an investigation could certainly qualify for one.

452
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,580
A visa?

453
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:12,900
Mm-hmm.

454
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,820
To stay here.

455
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,740
That's right.

456
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,880
So are you now the tooth fairy?

457
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,580
Pardon me?

458
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,520
Santa Claus, the one who hands out presents.

459
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,120
You know, I get them all mixed up.

460
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,060
And then the Easter Bunny.

461
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:23,840
What's with that?

462
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,620
Aidan said you'd play stupid.

463
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,640
Oh, it's like that.

464
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,780
Yeah, it's like that.

465
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,560
So what happened?

466
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,620
Aidan forget to pay you this month?

467
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,040
Let's just cut the crap, okay?

468
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:44,740
Get to the part where you tell me where Kamal has gone and where he stashes his chips.

469
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,000
Um, I told you I don't know.

470
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:48,840
Hmm.

471
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,560
Sophie, did you enjoy prison the last time you were in?

472
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,140
Oh yeah, I looked into that too.

473
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,780
My sources tell me it hasn't gotten any nicer inside.

474
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,500
I'm headed for refugee camp.

475
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,340
You think prison is a threat?

476
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,340
Ah, this is gonna be tough on Aidan.

477
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,460
He was counting on you.

478
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,540
Aidan's real trusting that way.

479
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,140
And you don't know where Dr.

480
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,900
Zamen is, huh?

481
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,720
Maybe if you slept on that.

482
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,460
Here.

483
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,660
You know, in a cell.

484
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,700
Hey, it's got a roof.

485
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,840
I've slept in worse places.

486
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,040
Ah, Sophie.

487
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,660
Sophie, Sophie, Sophie.

488
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:37,100
You know, there is nothing between you and the big bad world, but that dress and my goodwill.

489
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:38,220
So…

490
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,480
I do like this dress.

491
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,460
So tell me, does it really matter what happens to one more colonial and his money, Sophia?

492
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,500
Tell you what, tell me where to find Kamal, and you and your boyfriend walk.

493
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,940
Hold out on me.

494
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,800
I send you back to the camps, and I will make it my business to see you never get out.

495
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,120
Is the choice really so hard?

496
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,620
I used to have this friend.

497
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,880
I met her in jail.

498
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,220
She was from Coral 2.

499
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,720
She said all immigration cops were the devil.

500
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,300
But you aren't the devil.

501
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:13,700
Gosh.

502
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,820
Thanks.

503
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,100
You're just the guy that runs into the quickie store to get the devil a box of breath mints.

504
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,340
Send the patrolman to my office, would you please?

505
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,110
I have some garbage I need to throw away.

506
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,700
Not now, Sarah John.

507
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,320
I can't.

508
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:42,980
Damn it.

509
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:43,780
Ronnie!

510
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,140
Sarah John, I told you I can't take all these personal calls at the office.

511
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,580
I'm sorry, I thought…

512
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,800
You're at the office?

513
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,100
I'm in a meeting.

514
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,320
In the cafeteria.

515
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,620
In the cafeteria?

516
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,300
Sarah John, you can't just keep calling me like we were still working at Pammy's together.

517
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,580
I don't live in Kentucky anymore.

518
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,740
I live in the real world now.

519
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,520
Okay, you just call me sometime when it's convenient.

520
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,440
Sarah John, I didn't mean it like that.

521
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,240
I just have to be…

522
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,260
I have to learn to be more professional.

523
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,940
I understand.

524
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:20,800
Alright, kid.

525
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,420
You ready to order?

526
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,980
I'll talk to you some other time, Ronnie, when you aren't so busy.

527
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,600
Sarah John, wait.

528
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,820
Damn it.

529
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,200
You gonna order or not?

530
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,700
Some of us have to work.

531
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,200
I just wanted a slice of pie.

532
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,660
Hey, you girls miss me?

533
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,560
Oh my God, you're covered in stains.

534
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,560
Yeah, I know.

535
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,860
But as long as I can rinse these camos off in cold water before they dry, they're gonna come right out.

536
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,320
I'm serious.

537
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,280
Okay, Jen.

538
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,800
Alarms and comms are still down.

539
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,940
No backup coming in.

540
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,620
How much of my 20 minutes is left?

541
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,020
Three minutes, 12 seconds.

542
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,780
According to building schematics, this flight of stairs leads down to a landing with a heavy door.

543
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,400
Beyond that, the U-turn and another set of steps.

544
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,300
Does that landing sound like a kill zone to me?

545
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,360
Yeah.

546
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,140
So how to get to them without going through the kill zone?

547
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,680
Wait.

548
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,760
Wait, Finn and Monster Anne should be right underneath us.

549
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,520
Where are you going with this, hon?

550
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,640
Okay, we gotta take our grenades and pile them in the middle of the room.

551
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,920
Oh, that.

552
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,780
We'll go through the floor.

553
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,580
Gladys, help me grab that filing cabinet.

554
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,340
Okay, go.

555
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,900
Pull out the drawers, prop it open side down over the grenades.

556
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,400
Nice.

557
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,980
We can straddle that gold desk over the filing cabinet.

558
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,580
Pretty slick, slick.

559
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,400
You know, my daddy always wanted me to play with matches.

560
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,180
If there's one thing that meant you…

561
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,200
It was blow things up.

562
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,060
I bet you run with scissors pretty good, too.

563
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,260
Prop the cabinet up with a chair leg so we can pitch one grenade in to set the others off.

564
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,520
Okay, clear the room!

565
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,360
Fire in the hole!

566
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,280
You do know how to make a mother proud.

567
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,140
I'm going down.

568
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,760
Come on, Gladys.

569
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,800
Got you covered.

570
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,300
Babysitter!

571
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,240
Oh, man.

572
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,500
Surprise.

573
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,520
Bigger dog after all, princess.

574
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,940
Now you stand, gun drawn.

575
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
Your crew around you…

576
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,240
Hey, I taught you good.

577
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,760
You taught me nothing!

578
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,120
This must be your mom, babysitter.

579
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,160
I knew you didn't get your looks from your dad.

580
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,100
You bastard.

581
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,180
Take him.

582
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,040
He paid the price for what he done.

583
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,100
Trying to sell me out to save your skin, Ann?

584
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,460
Gladys, we're here, kiddo.

585
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,820
I don't know what to do.

586
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,600
Kill Finn.

587
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,460
Let Monster Ann go.

588
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,680
Make it worth your while.

589
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,220
I just don't know.

590
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,920
Jim, this isn't who you are.

591
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,780
He shot him.

592
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,420
He shot him like a dog!

593
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,240
Jim didn't want this for you.

594
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,260
Still not pulling the trigger, babysitter.

595
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,920
Lot I could still teach you.

596
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,840
You know it!

597
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,720
What kind of daughter am I?

598
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,080
The best, Jim.

599
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,240
Your father was so proud of you.

600
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,460
And he would never want you to turn into…

601
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,520
…

602
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,200
one of us.

603
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,740
Hey, hey, hey.

604
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,920
Talkin' truth, babysitter.

605
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,140
Shut up!

606
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,620
I've never been much of a mother for you, Jan.

607
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,420
Never got to bandage up a script for you.

608
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,720
Never got to read you a story at bedtime.

609
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,320
Never got to brush your hair.

610
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,180
But I can do this.

611
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,480
No!

612
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,520
I didn't order this.

613
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,180
You got something against clam chowder?

614
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,160
No, I love clam chowder.

615
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,760
It's not a pie.

616
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,780
What kind of meal is that?

617
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,540
Eat your soup.

618
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,060
But I can't afford…

619
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,600
It's not chowder.

620
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,740
Bottom of the kettle, left over from lunch.

621
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,040
They were just gonna throw it away.

622
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,460
But I…

623
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,680
Oh yeah, here's some crackers.

624
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,880
Are you being nice to me?

625
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,720
Yeah, we're gonna throw it on.

626
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,740
You are.

627
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,120
You are being nice to me.

628
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,040
How's the chowder?

629
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,960
Try it.

630
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,380
Oh.

631
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,340
They were gonna throw it out.

632
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,500
It's really good.

633
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,660
Thank you so much.

634
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,880
Don't start that again.

635
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,460
Yes, ma'am.

636
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,820
I mean, I'll try not to, ma'am.

637
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,960
I got customers.

638
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,280
Mom, can I have an ice cream bar on the way home?

639
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,720
No, it'll make you sick.

640
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,020
You can have a freezing.

641
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,740
Excuse me, can you tell me the time?

642
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,640
Tim is late.

643
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,680
Maybe he got busted.

644
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,580
This friend is supposed to be meeting me here.

645
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,780
She better come quick.

646
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,480
How did you know my friend was a girl?

647
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,600
Lucky guess.

648
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,860
You like freezies?

649
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,460
I like ice cream bars, but I'm not allowed.

650
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,340
How come?

651
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,440
Doctor said she had food intolerances, said avoid dairy, weeds.

652
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,180
Doesn't matter what she eats or doesn't eat, she still gets sick.

653
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,100
They tested her?

654
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,020
Too expensive.

655
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,780
I couldn't do that.

656
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,660
We waited four hours and Eleanor had a tummy ache the whole time, and the doctor saw us for five minutes.

657
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,920
I cried and I cried because my stomach hurt so bad.

658
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,400
That doesn't sound right.

659
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,500
What, you're a doctor?

660
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,060
No, but I used to work in a hospital.

661
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,400
How long has she had trouble?

662
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,920
I got it from Ekatrina.

663
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,500
Ekatrina used to watch her back when I had a job.

664
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,740
Wait, there's my friend.

665
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,680
No, it's not her.

666
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,360
That's a guy.

667
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,480
Oh.

668
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:16,920
Oh.

669
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,820
She caught food intolerances from someone?

670
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,540
You can't do that.

671
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,720
Ekatrina got sick and went to the hospital.

672
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,120
We don't know what happened to her.

673
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,460
I miss her.

674
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,080
Staying with her was fun.

675
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,960
One time we went out to her cousin's farm for the weekend.

676
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,240
Ekatrina had a lot of cousins, all of them guys.

677
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,140
She was young and pretty, you know.

678
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,880
We milked the cow and we went in the pond and we had tadpoles in a jar, but mom said I couldn't bring them home.

679
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,800
Does she throw up?

680
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,480
No, she gets diarrhea, runs a fever, she's lost weight.

681
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,880
That's not food intolerance.

682
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,100
Look, go back to the clinic, tell them she was exposed to TB.

683
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:52,900
TB?

684
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,700
Yes.

685
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,120
Tell them your neighbor had intestinal TB, not the kind in your lungs.

686
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,960
Public health law says they have to test your kid if she's been exposed.

687
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:00,780
You're sure?

688
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,440
I'm sure.

689
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,980
And tell them about the fever.

690
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,920
I used to work in a hospital.

691
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,900
Gee, thanks.

692
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,240
Thank you so much.

693
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,000
Look, what's your next stop?

694
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't really know.

695
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,280
My friend was kind of in charge of that.

696
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,360
I'm headed east, all the way to the east coast.

697
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,160
Here comes the bus.

698
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,300
Look, my sister Cammie lives in Reno.

699
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,740
You need to pick up her good-for-nothing son.

700
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,860
You take this bus back to Reno and Cammie will put you up for the night.

701
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,080
Wait, but you don't even know me.

702
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,840
Here, I'll write down Cammie's name and address and I'll let her know you're coming.

703
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,820
Why are you doing this?

704
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,420
I never knew I could make them test her.

705
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,360
The stomach thing, I've been so worried.

706
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,160
It's nothing.

707
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,040
And I'm not a doctor, but she should get a test.

708
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,340
What time is it?

709
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,320
Quarter past six.

710
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,840
She said she'd be here at five thirty.

711
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,620
Is your friend young and pretty?

712
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,280
Yeah.

713
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,600
You have a lot of choices, you pretty ones.

714
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,060
She wants this ex-boyfriend.

715
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,680
She was just going to stop by and see him.

716
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,300
Reno!

717
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,900
I told her she should stay with him.

718
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,940
I told her it was crazy to come with me.

719
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,780
All aboard who's coming aboard?

720
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,640
Everybody up.

721
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,840
You riding, son?

722
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,020
Just a second.

723
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,680
She's not coming, kiddo.

724
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,400
I told her not to come with me, but she said she told me.

725
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,220
She's not coming.

726
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,900
Yeah, I know.

727
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,660
Done with that bowl yet?

728
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,480
Yes, ma'am.

729
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,100
Thank you again, so much.

730
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,800
What was about your age when my husband died?

731
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,840
I'm sorry?

732
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,600
They came to my door to give me the news.

733
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,180
These two Navy guys in full fancy dress uniforms.

734
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,900
Covey's got the whole ship.

735
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,360
Hundred and thirty men lost.

736
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,920
I was eight months pregnant and fat as a horse.

737
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,300
Oh my God.

738
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,040
I'm so sorry.

739
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,160
I waddled out of my apartment and walked the streets for hours.

740
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,320
Just at random, you know?

741
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,340
Not going anywhere.

742
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,980
It's like my whole life hadn't even started and was already over.

743
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,140
No job, no money, no husband.

744
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:17,940
Nothing.

745
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,560
What did you do?

746
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,140
That day, somebody did something nice for me.

747
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,760
Made a difference.

748
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,800
I remember that.

749
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,560
Oh my God.

750
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,180
I'm nothing like that.

751
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,180
I don't deserve you.

752
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,960
I'm just a stupid college kid screwing up my job.

753
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,920
It's not a contest, kid.

754
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,700
Right.

755
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,320
You're right.

756
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,360
And remember, if you get fired, there's always waiting tables.

757
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,820
Can I have my chips, please?

758
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,580
You know, no special training required.

759
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,380
The most portable job in the galaxy.

760
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,200
Everybody's got to eat and everybody hates to cook.

761
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,360
As long as you have people skills.

762
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,860
Excuse me.

763
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,360
Can I have my check, please?

764
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,900
Would you mind shutting the hell up, you fat cow?

765
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,920
Can't you see I'm helping another customer?

766
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,320
Okay.

767
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,400
I'm sorry.

768
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,020
Talk about rude.

769
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,480
Some people.

770
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,720
Anyway, like I said, you got a few people skills and you don't mind the kitchen smells.

771
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,640
It's a good job.

772
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,740
Can I ask what it was?

773
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,240
The nice thing someone did?

774
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,460
Oh, man.

775
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,640
You promised me a job for after the kid was born.

776
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,680
This job here, actually.

777
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,600
Eight months pregnant, you know?

778
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,320
Came through that door and spent my last credit on a slice of key lime pie.

779
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,580
That is a good story.

780
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:52,140
Do you ever have one of those days where you just want to give up?

781
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:52,960
What?

782
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,820
Doesn't everybody?

783
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,140
What?

784
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:55,860
Greg?

785
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,340
That's my husband.

786
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,720
The Cubbies took his ship out with a plasma torpedo.

787
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,120
I heard the transmissions.

788
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,180
It was almost 60 seconds from impact to when they threw the hull plating.

789
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,060
You listen to the recordings.

790
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,060
You can hear them on the bridge saying goodbye.

791
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,760
Yeah.

792
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,320
I think about that a lot.

793
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,720
That 60 seconds.

794
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,040
What he was thinking.

795
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,100
I can't even imagine.

796
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:27,020
Now I got a boy at home wants to be a Marine when he grows up.

797
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,140
Yes, it just doesn't seem like the right time to give up.

798
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,520
Seems like it's not about how you feel this thing.

799
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,240
What you have to do.

800
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,640
Yeah.

801
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:41,780
Yeah.

802
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,920
Ronnie, it's Herzog.

803
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,840
What do you want?

804
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,140
I spoke to your tech a couple of weeks ago.

805
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,000
My tech?

806
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,580
Tech specialist, Carmy.

807
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,900
You wonder why she wasn't in her office?

808
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,380
Yeah.

809
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,780
She's on maternity leave.

810
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,540
She's never going to be a mother, Ronnie, but before she disappeared, I got to talk to her.

811
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,020
Disappeared?

812
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,600
You were right about the artifact.

813
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,800
It's counting down.

814
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,080
What happened to her?

815
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,980
It doesn't matter.

816
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,020
What matters is the artifact.

817
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,500
I can't.

818
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,340
Standish is watching me.

819
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,280
Ronnie, you have to.

820
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,500
What's going to happen when that device goes off?

821
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,020
Nobody knows.

822
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,060
When it was activated, it sent a huge ripple through the slipstream.

823
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:37,120
When it goes off, at the very least, it's probably going to cause a disruption that the Covenant will notice.

824
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,860
I can't.

825
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,360
You have to get someone else to do it.

826
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,560
Do it yourself.

827
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,500
I'm sorry, I can't.

828
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,380
Standish thinks I'm dead right now.

829
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,500
I should be dead right now.

830
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,040
What?

831
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,660
Standish arranged an accident.

832
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:57,860
It's just luck that the car hit the water and skipped the way it did, allowing the safety system to do its job.

833
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:58,560
No.

834
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,580
I'm okay.

835
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,240
Compression fracture and a couple of vertebrae, broken ribs, a broken arm, but all things that will heal.

836
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,820
And it's lucky that when as long as Standish thinks I'm dead, I've got a little breathing room.

837
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,500
But Ronnie, you're all I've got.
