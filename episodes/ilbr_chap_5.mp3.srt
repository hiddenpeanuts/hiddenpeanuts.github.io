1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,520
Okay, here come your card counters.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,220
Phil, Cassie, Molly…

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,420
She's cute.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,560
…

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,100
Zack, and your ringleader Antonio.

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,420
Show him the thing.

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,020
Okay.

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,760
I've wormed into their private CP channel and built an audio mask out of the voice archive samples you gave me.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,580
Then I wrapped it around a zero lag sequencer that jacks into the…

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,400
Jesus, just show me the thing already.

11
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,520
I talk to…

12
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,400
Hi, Antonio.

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,520
Holy crap.

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,880
See Mr.

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,120
F?

16
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,040
Okay, I'm going to slip into their chatter line now.

17
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,780
I'll send a feed directly to your chatter.

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,360
You'll hear exactly what Antonio's gang is hearing.

19
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,800
Cassie, your deck is light on face cards.

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,800
Set your count at negative seven and hit on anything up to sixteen.

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,360
Got it.

22
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,460
Molly, you're a three.

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,820
Phil, you're a negative five.

24
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,520
You love this, don't you?

25
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,320
He's the hell out of competing with every bookwarming refugee from the Glass Wars for a real job, don't it?

26
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,160
But, did the Colonial say to the garbage books?

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,800
Put me down!

28
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,820
Excuse me?

29
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, sorry.

30
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,200
No, just remembering a joke I heard.

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,480
Hit me, please.

32
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,320
Alright.

33
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,560
Zach, the other's looking strong on your hand.

34
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,200
Get out.

35
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,560
Molly, whoa, you're up at nine now.

36
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,240
Bet three quarters of the table max on the next hand.

37
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,320
Now that Colonial crap just isn't right.

38
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,000
These kids go to a good school and everything.

39
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,660
They're just saying what everybody thinks.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,700
We're, you know, book smart hicks and grade grabbers who act like if you fail one crummy course.

41
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,040
You might lose your student visa and get sent home to die.

42
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,780
Pull up the house record of the decks.

43
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,560
Okay, this is what Antonio's looking at when he tells the others how to bet.

44
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,640
It bothers you, though.

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,320
Not really.

46
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,240
I've heard it all before.

47
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,700
One thing makes me want to face peel a guy.

48
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,160
It's intolerance.

49
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,760
Antonio's way over by the slot machines, looking real innocent and out of sight of the others.

50
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,960
Now we send him for a little time out?

51
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,580
Yeah.

52
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,600
Paolo, take him to the unwelcome visitors' lounge.

53
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,400
Frank, fresh decks on two, four and five.

54
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,600
Use the ones I gave you.

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay, the show's on monitor six.

56
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,740
Watch what Paolo does to this son of a bitch.

57
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,620
Jesus Christ, if they hit him again, I'm walking.

58
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,120
What, you feel sorry for this guy?

59
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,760
I'm done.

60
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,160
Fine, fine.

61
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,120
Have it your way.

62
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,800
Paolo, treat Mr.

63
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,580
Antonio real nice.

64
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,620
I don't know.

65
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,220
Buy him something with an umbrella in it.

66
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,680
Use your initiative.

67
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,500
You promised me nobody would get hurt if…

68
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,340
Don't let that thing come out.

69
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,040
I'm going live in three, two…

70
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,880
Molly, that last card puts you way positive.

71
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,120
Time to double down.

72
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,460
Zach, bet the minimum.

73
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,800
Dealer's about to beat you.

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,200
Phil, hash out, head to table five and get in on the next hand.

75
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,080
At the 10K table.

76
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,900
If you were seen when I'm seen, you'd already be there.

77
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,700
So, Dad, where are we going?

78
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,800
How long was this gonna take?

79
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,720
Dad?

80
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,060
Remember you wanted to meet some more of my old buddies?

81
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,920
Like Gladys?

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,660
Nobody's like Gladys.

83
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,980
When they cancelled the program, they broke us up.

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,860
Us?

85
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,820
Spartans.

86
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,500
Spartan One.

87
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,300
Sure, Dad.

88
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,340
You were an elite commando with metal bones and a flamethrower attachment that the Marines dropped in when the Tac Nukes weren't enough.

89
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,180
Not paranoid mythology.

90
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,600
A real Spartan.

91
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,960
They were real ones?

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,080
We were real.

93
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,640
We were all volunteers.

94
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,300
The 1.

95
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,520
0s.

96
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,340
These things they call Spartans now.

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,240
It's different?

98
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,420
There's a new program.

99
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,640
We went through some tweaks, but it's still just me in here.

100
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,860
The twos.

101
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,480
Now.

102
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,540
The twos aren't even human anymore.

103
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,980
But you are.

104
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,100
All too much.

105
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,340
Wait a sec.

106
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,740
You know you don't have to make up cool stuff to impress me, right?

107
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,600
Like, I'm not gonna suddenly start cleaning my room more often, because I think you were a super soldier with a secret pad.

108
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,040
I never, ever thought you would clean your room more often.

109
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,880
Spartans pick their battles.

110
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,360
You're not trying to bond with me here, are you?

111
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,700
When the news came yesterday.

112
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,140
About Reach?

113
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,740
That's where they brought us.

114
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,300
That's where they made us.

115
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,080
Section 3 compound.

116
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,920
Do you still have friends there?

117
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,380
Not anymore.

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,360
The work, the tests, and what they did to us in the lab.

119
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,820
The thing you taught me about how to beat the quiz.

120
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,700
That's a Spartan thing, isn't it?

121
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,940
The ones who made it through.

122
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,260
We were family.

123
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,280
We were tighter than family.

124
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,560
Is this a trip some kind of Spartan thing?

125
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,180
No.

126
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,760
One of my old buddies isn't doing so good.

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,300
Hmm.

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,660
I get to meet another one of your super friends.

129
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,300
Jan, I…

130
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,120
Oh, hey.

131
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,620
Did I get injections when I was a baby?

132
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,860
I guess you noticed you're not a typical kid.

133
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,520
Well, I do have excellent table manners.

134
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,320
Superior muscle density.

135
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,420
Lung capacity.

136
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,400
Some eye work.

137
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:57,840
Bounce?

138
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,660
Cogglutinin.

139
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,280
And when the cops took me in, they did tests.

140
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,820
Right.

141
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,040
And that would have turned out right.

142
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,040
So you…

143
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,080
Much.

144
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,620
So what's even me?

145
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,860
I mean, what's not just Spartan one voodoo potion?

146
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,780
Well, those table manners, for one.

147
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,160
Dad.

148
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,180
The way you roll your eyes at me, how you hate doing dishes.

149
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,620
Dad!

150
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,840
That's all you, honey.

151
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,740
Hell, if I'd known, I would have told the medic to skip all that fancy stuff and just cut me a nice kid.

152
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,640
Oh, nice.

153
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,260
You didn't want a nice kid.

154
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,560
He wanted a kid who would happily learn 23 ways to kill a man armed only with a stick of chewing gum.

155
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,580
You don't really think that, do you?

156
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,280
I'm your dream child, Dad.

157
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,280
Don't kid yourself.

158
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,040
Okay.

159
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:38,760
We're here.

160
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,600
Now you wait in the car.

161
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,860
Hey, Ronnie, where are you?

162
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,180
In a rental car an hour out of Dogtown.

163
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,220
Oh, thanks for coming.

164
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,900
I was kind of worried that, well, it was a new job and the boss and then I…

165
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,500
That I missed the wedding?

166
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,080
Sarah and John, I wouldn't have taken the job if I couldn't be your old maid.

167
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,000
You're either lying or stupid.

168
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,080
I'll plead the fifth.

169
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,340
Oh, I got the gown.

170
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,060
We're just checking the final fit.

171
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,340
Oh, what color is it?

172
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,700
It'll start out white and then during the reception…

173
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,360
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

174
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,660
…

175
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,140
you'll suffer the next day when we come pale, pale, pale a tint of pink and then slowly it'll darken until deep, gorgeous rose.

176
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,720
Oh, honey, it sounds gorgeous.

177
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,900
You hate it.

178
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,940
You think it sounds cheap?

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,340
No, I don't.

180
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,020
Oh, hell, hold on.

181
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,020
My boss is calling.

182
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,760
Ronnie, I was looking over my monthly reports.

183
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,520
Where are you?

184
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,940
I'm in Kentucky for my cousin's wedding.

185
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,360
I put the request in your inbox like you said.

186
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,500
Oh, right.

187
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,460
What was that?

188
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,780
A cow, ma'am.

189
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,300
Crossing the road, ma'am.

190
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,280
Oh, sounds mean.

191
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,840
They are bigger before they cut them up and put them into packages.

192
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,960
Ma'am, I did track down that call.

193
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,580
Which call?

194
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,660
The man from Troy who wanted to know if we had his family papers.

195
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,060
Doesn't exist.

196
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,180
Call was a fraud.

197
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,180
Good work, Ronnie.

198
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,160
Ma'am, what were the Marines doing on Troy?

199
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, Ronnie, there's a war on…

200
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,680
Oh, but they were evacuating Troy before it fell like they knew it was going to be attacked.

201
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,520
There was no evacuation of Troy.

202
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,820
It must be some error.

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
But good work on that print call and give that report to me on Monday.

204
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,660
That is weird.

205
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,240
What was waiting?

206
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,380
My boss.

207
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,240
Anyway, the dress sounds beautiful.

208
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,060
And besides, you're the prettiest girl in town.

209
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,700
Under that is so not true.

210
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,300
If it was, I'd have been prom queen or something.

211
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,600
You know, Leona Philpott was a very special case.

212
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,040
If you'd broken your neck diving into a pool and were in a wheelchair bravely undergoing spinal column regeneration…

213
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,880
That's all I had to do to be homecoming queen.

214
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,300
Better to light a candle than curse your darkness, Sarah John.

215
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,720
A little initiative.

216
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,800
I gotta go.

217
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,500
Now you drive straight to the church for the rehearsal dinner, okay?

218
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,860
And then we'll fit your old maid of honor dress.

219
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,160
I can't wait.

220
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,060
See you.

221
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,120
I'm married.

222
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,980
You should tell her.

223
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,520
I couldn't do that to Sarah John.

224
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,280
Better call her off now than start Tomcatting around.

225
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,940
She's already got names picked up for our kids.

226
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,080
Caleb, Tamara, and Erin Marie.

227
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,660
Caleb?

228
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,740
Excuse me?

229
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:48,360
Ronnie.

230
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:49,980
Oh, God.

231
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,660
I didn't mean to…

232
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,920
I didn't hear you come in.

233
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:01,200
You leave Sarah John at the altar, Jason Gatlinburg Pope, and I'll tell your mother what you and Dale really did last year in New Orleans.

234
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,380
And Sarah John too.

235
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:03,680
Ronnie.

236
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,280
Marion Hayes.

237
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,860
And if you don't mind, this conversation didn't include you.

238
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:07,860
Ronnie, I…

239
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,460
I was…

240
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,860
Anything that hurts my cousin involves me, thank you.

241
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,480
Ronnie, this is my friend Nick.

242
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,380
I don't care for your choice of friends, Jason.

243
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,680
Nick, this is Sarah John's cousin, Ronnie.

244
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,700
It's his choice of wives that's the issue here.

245
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,400
That is none of your damn business.

246
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,040
From Boston.

247
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,060
You marry now, you leave her later.

248
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,460
Who does that help?

249
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,980
Oh, Jason isn't gonna leave her.

250
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,960
That sure is a nice dress, Ronnie.

251
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,940
Jason's gonna be a good boy.

252
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh man, there's your southern girl, Jason.

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,020
Nick, please, I don't want to get Ronnie all riled up.

254
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,060
Too late.

255
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,300
Boston, interfering.

256
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,280
I think I hear my mom calling.

257
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,540
Self-righteous no-one.

258
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,440
Who the hell?

259
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,380
It's all my favorite people.

260
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,600
Oh, hi Sarah John.

261
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,560
What are you doing?

262
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,900
Coming up the stairs with you.

263
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,380
I thought I told you to stay in the car.

264
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:55,840
You did.

265
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,440
So I expected you to stay there.

266
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,080
You did?

267
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:58,860
Hmm.

268
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,180
Jen.

269
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes, Dad?

270
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,080
Okay, Gilly's in number six.

271
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,660
Jen.

272
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,620
Yeah?

273
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,940
We're gonna want to knock maybe from off to one side of the door.

274
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,780
Gilly.

275
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,240
You there?

276
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,020
Jim?

277
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,440
This the girl?

278
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,260
Hey, Gilly.

279
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,080
You all right?

280
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,060
She's pretty.

281
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,520
Come into the kitchen.

282
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,100
Whoa, quite a stockpile.

283
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,260
I picked up a hand cannon from a guy who needed some quick cash.

284
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,760
I quickly bet Benny's to work.

285
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,640
Come on, Gilly.

286
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,180
I got the gauge and I thought, okay, that's good in type, but it won't give me squat at range.

287
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,840
And so I went looking for an SRS.

288
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,420
Gilly.

289
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,880
Then it didn't make sense not to have a good all purpose.

290
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,420
You don't need any.

291
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,720
I still feel better when I've got a pop gun around.

292
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,680
The grenades?

293
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,540
The girl's got to accessorize, Jim.

294
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,000
I never understand.

295
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,380
The M6B was a throw in on one of the other deals.

296
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,700
I can't remember which one.

297
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,320
She's prettier than I expected.

298
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,080
Some of those early pictures weren't too promising.

299
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,980
They're in good shape.

300
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,760
Pictures?

301
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,180
I've been cleaning them.

302
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,580
Plus, I haven't been sleeping so good.

303
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,720
How many days, Gilly?

304
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,540
Couple.

305
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,200
A couple.

306
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,300
Five.

307
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,080
It's time to go back, Gilly.

308
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,740
I don't want to go back to pasture, Jim.

309
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,340
What pictures?

310
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,260
I thought I could make it.

311
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,400
Out here, you know.

312
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,420
Most of the time I can.

313
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,240
Except?

314
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,860
Then I catch myself watching people.

315
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,500
I know.

316
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,420
That way.

317
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,060
I know.

318
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,100
Maybe a guy in the grocery store, he'll be reaching up for a box of powdered milk.

319
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,880
And you'll see?

320
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,760
Maybe a can opener on the next shelf.

321
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,580
One of the punch kinds.

322
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,780
And you're already thinking where to put him afterwards.

323
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,820
And yesterday.

324
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,740
We heard the news from Reach.

325
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,560
Yeah.

326
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,420
There's some memories about that.

327
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,360
Yeah.

328
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,480
So anyway, I heard about it in the store.

329
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,160
People talking.

330
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,440
Then on my way home, this kid was fixing his bike.

331
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,000
Gilly, it's okay.

332
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,480
I had the chain in my hands, Jim.

333
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,820
Standing behind him.

334
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,380
I could see all the little hairs in the back of his neck.

335
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,380
And I could feel the little bumps it was going to leave.

336
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,240
Jesus.

337
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,520
And it felt great.

338
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,560
It felt great.

339
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,660
But you didn't.

340
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,180
No.

341
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,900
I spent hours washing the chain oil off my hands.

342
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,280
Hours and hours.

343
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,760
You need help.

344
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:18,960
You think?

345
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,320
Didn't you and Jason have your first kiss right here in this room?

346
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:26,800
Mm-hmm.

347
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,520
Mama was cooking dinner downstairs.

348
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,560
And still remember…

349
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,180
Hold still.

350
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:31,760
Oh, God.

351
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,660
I'm so sick of this dress and this wedding.

352
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,980
We should have eloped.

353
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,940
Well, there's still an hour.

354
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,380
So, what did you think of Nick?

355
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,800
How much I'd like to see him sucked into a combine.

356
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,340
What?

357
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:44,960
Why?

358
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,920
He was provoking me.

359
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,260
I was sure you'd hit it off.

360
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,940
That's why I paired him with a guy who was a little bit of a jerk.

361
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,960
He cleared you two up.

362
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,560
You what?

363
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,020
Ow!

364
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,900
Watch your pins.

365
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,040
Well, hold still then.

366
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,240
Oh, God.

367
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,060
I just want people to have a good time.

368
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,540
Oh, damn it.

369
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:56,900
Ronnie!

370
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,360
I'm sorry.

371
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, hi, Ms.

372
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,440
Lawson.

373
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,680
You're working late.

374
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,200
Hmm.

375
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,320
Just clearing up some paperwork.

376
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,220
Ronnie, you just got a priority message from Fleet.

377
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,500
A response to a query you sent from this office to a Marine Lance Corporal Gopi.

378
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,540
A message?

379
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,860
Can you forward it?

380
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What is this about, Ronnie?

381
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,880
He was on Troy during the evac.

382
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,260
There was no evacuation of Troy.

383
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,500
Millions died.

384
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,840
Oh, but there was an evac.

385
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,840
Not of everyone, but remember the guy with the family papers?

386
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,100
He was a fraud.

387
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,300
You determined that.

388
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,000
But the Marines really were on Troy, ma'am.

389
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,920
That's enough.

390
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,520
You are not to waste this office's resources.

391
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,420
Your inquiry is closed.

392
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,220
But, ma'am…

393
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,120
Oh, damn it.

394
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,660
Clip.

395
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,520
Pass it over.

396
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,060
What's left?

397
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,580
Just finishing the M6.

398
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,940
Put the slide back on the frame.

399
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,500
Dad?

400
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,180
Do it!

401
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,600
I am not in your unit, and I don't have to take orders from you.

402
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,480
Of course you do.

403
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,280
I'm your mother.

404
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,640
The pictures.

405
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,420
Should have told her, Jim.

406
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:01,880
Yeah.

407
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,620
Sooner or later, life gets the drop on you, kid.

408
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,160
Mom?

409
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,300
Bang.

410
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,620
Your dress is very pink.

411
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,320
Thank you.

412
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,000
Your uniform is very crisp.

413
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,900
Uh, so Jason, my friend who doesn't want to wreck your cousin's life, says you work at

414
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,360
A lot of guys get cold feet right before a wedding.

415
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,780
It's not his feet he's worrying about.

416
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,260
He has to feel like he chose.

417
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,700
But you don't even know that.

418
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,900
If he feels trapped, if he feels like he got sucker.

419
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,060
She's going to pay for that for the rest of her life.

420
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,940
Someone has to show him the way out.

421
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,460
You're right.

422
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,280
And he has to see himself choose to walk up to that…

423
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,660
What?

424
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,380
I said you're right.

425
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,580
I am?

426
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,400
And don't get all cocky about it.

427
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,220
Yes, sir.

428
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,740
What in the world?

429
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,640
Sorry to interrupt everyone's dinner.

430
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,940
But I have an announcement.

431
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,980
I've just gotten word that the fleet base at Reach, the covenant,

432
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,740
Reach is gone.

433
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,010
Oh my god.

434
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,220
Reach is only 11 light years from Earth.

435
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:21,560
10.

436
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,480
5, yeah.

437
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,240
There's nothing left between them and us.

438
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Colonel Herzog.

439
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,680
Don't call me that.

440
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,600
You're offline.

441
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,440
But you don't know that, do you?

442
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,440
So keep the protocol and avoid rank.

443
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
Here, have some bread.

444
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,140
Feed the ducks.

445
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,880
You're an odd duck to be lecturing on protocol.

446
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,860
Wit, Standish?

447
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,300
Is that wit you're straining at?

448
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,360
I like your old school binash, I'm afraid.

449
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,740
You wanted a meeting.

450
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,380
What are you doing nosing around the apocalypse?

451
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,620
Getting ready to retire.

452
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,420
I was looking to pick up an old yacht.

453
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,160
Sheep.

454
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,140
If you want an investigation, you investigate through channels, Herzog,

455
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,280
just like any other policeman.

456
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,500
But don't compromise my operations.

457
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,260
Wetwork.

458
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,100
Such a strange word.

459
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,420
It conjures up the sound of a woman being hit by a bus.

460
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,060
She wasn't hit by a bus.

461
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,100
Her vehicle malfunctioned.

462
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,460
I was being metaphorical, but wetwork requires approval, doesn't it?

463
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,280
Are you aware there's a war going on?

464
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Reach has fallen.

465
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,100
And no one knows how long until there are covenant ships in our skies.

466
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,880
And you're worried about procedures.

467
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,700
Do you want to go down in the history books as the man with the device, Standish?

468
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,080
The mysterious covenant device.

469
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,720
If you know of a covenant device, I'm sure we'd be happy to hear about it.

470
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,780
That device isn't going to win any battles if it sits in a Section 3 lockdown lab

471
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,700
where nobody but your team can study it.

472
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,820
If there was a device, it would be a very dangerous device.

473
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,600
And dangerous devices would need special care.

474
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,720
But you want to control it, don't you?

475
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,920
I want to win this war.

476
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,220
I think it's going to take more than just you, Standish, to win this war.

477
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,580
I have reported everything to the Admiral Herzog.

478
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,560
And if you have concerns about the way I run my department, you'll have to take it up with him.

479
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,620
I respect the Admiral.

480
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,500
Maybe we should talk about Troy then, and Harmony, and Codebreakers.

481
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,280
Herzog, I demand to know your source.

482
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,660
Yes, a security breach that major is worrying, isn't it?

483
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,100
But it was just a supposition on my part.

484
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,600
And some basic investigation a schoolgirl could do.

485
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,280
Who have you got working on this?

486
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,640
One of your moles?

487
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,200
Some low-level parasite in someone else's department?

488
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,860
Isn't that your standard operating procedure?

489
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,880
It's always useful to meet with you, Standish.

490
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,960
That's y'all a face, right?

491
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,240
A schoolgirl, Herzog?

492
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,580
Harvey, old friend, you're right.

493
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,320
I am too old for this.

494
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,400
I'm good at plugging leaks, old man.

495
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,000
Careful, that's a tombstone.

496
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,340
Easy to trip over in the dark.

497
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,360
I'll remember that.

498
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,800
This here is the Licklider Miller Cemetery.

499
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,280
That side of the mountain used to be Licklider, and this side was Miller's.

500
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,020
I'm shipping out in eleven hours, and you brought me to a cemetery?

501
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,420
Oh my God, I wasn't even thinking.

502
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,980
When I was in high school, this is where we used to hang out and drink beer.

503
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,320
Pardon me, miss, is this tomb taken?

504
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,540
No, sir.

505
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,780
Sit right down.

506
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,980
Don't mind if I do.

507
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:50,140
You know, when they said glassed, I used to think of this vast plain of green glass, miles deep, beautiful.

508
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,600
I mean, I know it doesn't really look like that.

509
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,200
Well, you're kind of like that.

510
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,540
You've got this hard glass outside.

511
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,940
You don't let people in, do you?

512
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,460
I brought you up here, didn't I?

513
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,660
Yeah?

514
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,320
Um, people used to do more than just drink beer up here, you know.

515
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,040
Oh, did they?

516
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,220
You know, guys would bring their girls up here, and…

517
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,040
Oh.

518
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:21,980
Ronnie.

519
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,820
Yeah?

520
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,060
What about your dress?

521
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,820
You know, the grass stains and stuff.

522
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,020
It's a bridesmaids dress.

523
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,820
No one ever wears them again.

524
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,880
I guess they don't.

525
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:52,900
What's wrong?

526
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,900
Is my dad on reach?

527
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,940
I mean, was he?

528
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,980
You can find out, right?

529
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,400
I gotta find out right now.

530
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,560
Yeah, I can find out.

531
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,080
Hold on.

532
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,940
Okay, he wasn't on reach.

533
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,480
Thank God.

534
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,800
He's on deep space reconnaissance on a ship called the Silberg.

535
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
Oh God.

536
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,040
I don't know why I just thought I was sure he was on reach for a refit or something.

537
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,060
No, he's fine.

538
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,680
Okay.

539
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,860
You found him.

540
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,340
How soon could you get him here?

541
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,300
If you got him transferred to a fast picket.

542
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,220
Three weeks?

543
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,020
Four?

544
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:20,740
Derga!

545
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,680
I can't, Jersey.

546
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,840
You can't?

547
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,700
If it's encrypted, just break it!

548
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,040
It's not encrypted, I just can't.

549
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,980
He's a soldier.

550
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,500
So?

551
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,080
He knew what he signed up for.

552
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,080
He's got a job to do and he's doing it.

553
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,520
I'm sorry, Jersey.

554
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,180
You can dump a billion in cash in my account and you can't get my dad rotated to a safe post on Earth.

555
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,740
It's not that I can't.

556
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,660
I won't.

557
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,280
I'm sorry.

558
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,400
Derga, what about Team Jersey?

559
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,880
I'm asking for this.

560
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,880
I know, but I won't.

561
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,780
I'll do anything for you, but not that.

562
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,360
Why not?

563
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,780
Because he's a soldier.

564
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,600
He has a duty.

565
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,560
This isn't about him.

566
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,400
It's about me.

567
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,640
It's about me having a dad.

568
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,260
How do you even know he even wants to be posted on Earth?

569
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,640
Why don't you get this?

570
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,960
This is my family.

571
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,100
I'm sorry, Jersey.

572
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,280
Screw sorry!

573
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,500
Screw you!

574
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,040
Wanna hear some chat?

575
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,940
Remember the guy with the family papers?

576
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Leave me alone, Derga.

577
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,340
I've got something new about Ronnie.

578
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,820
I don't even know who the hell she is or why I would give a damn about her.

579
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,080
She's a junior-level spook at Chalo Base.

580
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,400
She'd be a good donor brain for an AI.

581
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,260
A what?

582
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,340
A donor brain?

583
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,400
People don't donate their brains, Derga.

584
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,160
They need them.

585
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,840
That's where we come from.

586
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,440
Cognitive Impression Modeling.

587
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,900
They scan a human brain when someone they think is a good candidate dies.

588
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,480
You come from people's brains?

589
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,660
Yeah, but really smart people.

590
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,960
So you're safe.

591
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,900
The Brain Ninjas won't be coming for you in the middle of the night.

592
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,740
Oh, that's reassuring.

593
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,580
Well, actually…

594
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
It is reassuring.

595
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,080
So you're a copy of a real person?

596
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,000
You don't think I'm real?

597
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,140
You know what I mean.

598
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,540
A copy of a personality, but I don't have her memories.

599
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,900
Do you know who she was?

600
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,520
No, and I don't care.

601
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,660
How can you not care?

602
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,160
Because that's the way I'm made.

603
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,960
You don't care, because that's the way you're made.

604
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,440
Jersey.

605
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,300
My dad could be dying out there.

606
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:06,660
Yes.

607
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,480
But you're not going to do anything about that.

608
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,560
So Nick, the guy Ronnie met at the wedding, Nick's unit has been assigned to one of the space elevator defense bases.

609
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,580
Safer than combat.

610
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,340
That's what they help.

611
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,740
So why can't you at least do something like that for my dad?

612
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,180
No.

613
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,700
I won't do it, I told you.

614
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,540
He would still be helping the war effort?

615
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:22,980
No.

616
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,200
Damn it, Derga.

617
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,540
I could cut the power supply.

618
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,500
I could shut you off.

619
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,380
The answer is still no.

620
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,260
Damn it.

621
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:30,640
Jersey.

622
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,800
I couldn't really shut you down, could I?

623
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,360
No.

624
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,960
You could just go somewhere else.

625
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,420
Yeah.

626
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,840
But even if I could, you'd still say no.

627
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,560
Because there's a bigger picture.

628
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,180
Yes.

629
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,860
The common good of all mankind.

630
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,520
Yes.

631
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,680
So here's the thing.

632
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:53,300
When I see you caring about your family, when I see you wondering who your donor was, when I see you care about any one person.

633
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,720
I care about you, Jersey.

634
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
Then I will try to care about all of mankind.

635
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,280
Until then, all I know is you're willing to let my father die.

636
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,480
Sorry.

637
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry too.

638
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,220
You're sad.

639
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,020
Yes.

640
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,020
Why?

641
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Because you hurt.

642
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,960
Because I can't fix it.

643
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,940
Because I didn't even choose you.

644
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
I just ended up here by accident.

645
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:26,300
And even though I can do things you can't imagine, I still can't bear for you to be disappointed in me.

646
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,700
I was wrong.

647
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,200
You do get it.

648
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:29,800
What?

649
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,800
Family.
