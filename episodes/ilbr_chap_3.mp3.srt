1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,720
Ooh, that was a mighty fine dinner, little lady.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,160
Yeah, you know, pushing the synthesize button, it's an art form.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,840
Jan gets insulted when you compliment your domestic skills, Gladys.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,620
I'm going out.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,640
Hey, you're not going out.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,720
Why not?

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,620
Because we have company, and because you're going to stay a little closer to base.

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,740
Dad, I'm not going to…

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,580
I told you I understood, and you said you trusted me.

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,700
Maybe I trust you a little too much.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,460
That's not fair, I told the guys…

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,220
I don't care what you told the guys.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,900
I'm saying you're in for the night.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,320
I'll help you with those dishes.

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,620
You just dump them in the sink.

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,300
Then I reckon I can help you dump.

17
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,680
You go watch some sports, Jim.

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,380
Ladies will like that.

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,640
He's a good man, your father.

20
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,060
If you're not his daughter, if you're his daughter, he's a jackass.

21
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,300
Jim, he was always a jackass girl.

22
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,360
If your mother hadn't taken pity on him, my boy'd still be single.

23
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,540
Did you know her?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,820
Oh, some parts of his life Jim never wanted to touch.

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,460
Oh, yeah.

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,300
But, I mean, at least you guys have lives.

27
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,580
I mean, I make one little mistake, and I'm not allowed to leave this stupid tenement.

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,680
Says who?

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,440
You heard him, Dad.

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,140
That dog won't hunt, Jan.

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,540
When I joined the Marines, I didn't ask my mama's permission.

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,900
Does he know you're in here, like, encouraging insurrection?

33
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,020
Oh, sure.

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,420
Your daddy just wants to keep you safe.

35
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,280
I know.

36
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,400
But he's still a jackass.

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,240
I caught him reading a manual once.

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,400
Sure enough.

39
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,380
Navy Publication FM 973.

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,180
Child rearing for part-time and auxiliary personnel.

41
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,180
Well, you should have seen the chapter on discipline.

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,200
Oh, no!

43
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,580
Hey, when you were my age, did you…

44
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,960
could you…

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,860
You're gonna spit this out before sunrise.

46
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,680
Well, there was this guy I met, and something he said just started me thinking.

47
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,760
Uh-oh.

48
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,640
I've been tweaked up, haven't I?

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,940
Not like you and Dad, I know that, but some.

50
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,000
Honey, I think…

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,720
And that's okay.

52
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,880
Hey, I'm grateful.

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,860
But let me do something with it.

54
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,020
Let me do something.

55
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,820
Hmm.

56
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,720
You got something to prove.

57
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,460
Just to myself.

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,660
You play Moons.

59
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,440
Yeah.

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,140
I bet Jim taught you a thing or two.

61
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,800
Boys and balls.

62
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,200
Rack them and break them.

63
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,820
Good damn, that's me you're quoting.

64
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,100
Me back before I…

65
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,880
Man discovered fire.

66
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,240
I will slap you as soon as look at you, Missy.

67
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,420
Now, you just remember that.

68
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,560
Dad!

69
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,220
My point being, I stopped by a moon parlor on the bus ride in.

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,710
Place called Sharpies.

71
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,680
I've heard about it.

72
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,580
Nothing good.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,720
Cops don't go to that part of town.

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,820
But, a girl like you could use a glimpse of reality.

75
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,020
Straighten out your priorities.

76
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,220
Dad would freak out if he heard you.

77
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,400
I think you were supposed to be a soothing maternal influence.

78
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,060
Yeah, well, soothing isn't my long suit.

79
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,740
Don't you worry about your dad.

80
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,380
I rank him anyhow.

81
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,740
What is that?

82
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,620
It's a chicken.

83
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,040
It's a raw chicken.

84
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,580
Sophia's coming for dinner tonight.

85
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,520
Hoo hoo.

86
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,040
She and Aidan split up?

87
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,520
No.

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,940
We're just friends.

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,440
Come on, nobody buys a whole chicken for a friend.

90
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,340
Can you even cook?

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,600
I finished med school.

92
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,880
How hard can cooking be?

93
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,900
Isn't raw chicken full of pathogens?

94
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,700
Should it even be sitting on the counter that way?

95
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,540
Oh, and I don't think our flash works.

96
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,160
What do you mean?

97
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,100
What I said, I think it only microwaves.

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,840
I think the baking cooking part is on the fritz.

99
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,500
It's not?

100
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,240
It is.

101
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,800
So I'll microwave it then.

102
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,480
I'm going out for dinner.

103
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,780
Can I get a table?

104
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,220
Hey, what are you doing in here?

105
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,300
Playing moons, if you don't mind.

106
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,480
Who do you think you are, grub?

107
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,360
Huh?

108
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,060
You're picking up men to lie to my face?

109
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,280
Imagine you can tussle with Finn, kiddo.

110
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,160
Come on, Finn.

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,740
I mean, come on.

112
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,820
I wouldn't lie.

113
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,080
Give me a PQI if you don't believe it.

114
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,240
What's going on?

115
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,700
Damn it.

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,180
Zip off your shirt out of the way and shut up.

117
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,080
For the sake of argument, say I slide you this time.

118
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,260
Send a message, cousin.

119
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,980
Come on over.

120
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,700
Free lunch on Finn.

121
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,120
Ain't happening, palo.

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,560
Ain't happening.

123
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,720
Oh, oh my god, god.

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,120
Oh god, please god, think of my family.

125
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
Reality, huh?

126
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,160
Thanks, Aunt Gladys.

127
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,500
Hey!

128
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,400
Nobody told me it was dime store bully night.

129
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,220
Is there a drink special with that?

130
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,600
Come to the job, nice little girl.

131
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,240
No babysitting jobs at Sharpies tonight?

132
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,620
At the tip of an M6 I see poking out from under your jacket, babysitter.

133
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,440
Are you just excited to meet Finn Kinkle?

134
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:13,900
M6C.

135
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,340
Chameleon 12-7.

136
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:15,820
Yeah.

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,420
12 shots.

138
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,100
Yeah.

139
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,220
There's more than 12 of us.

140
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,420
There's only one of you.

141
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,200
Whoa, whoa, are you trying to get me killed?

142
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,680
Gee, you're welcome.

143
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,640
Let him go.

144
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,600
Now, see, that was a young move.

145
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,180
Whoever's running you needs to smooth out some edges here.

146
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,880
You can't put the hammer to Finn in his own place.

147
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,400
I got a deal for you.

148
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,140
Yeah?

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,320
See, the grub, let's play for his skin.

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,940
We'll play moons.

151
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,420
You win, the grub slides.

152
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,020
I win.

153
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,220
Why, I guess I get your skin.

154
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,000
Gee, I'm on your age, sir.

155
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,740
An offer like that would be illegal.

156
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,800
I guess then if I win I'll find some babysitting for you to do.

157
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,080
Is it supposed to look like that?

158
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,560
What?

159
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,560
The chicken.

160
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,040
Oh yeah, it's said to cut it up into eight pieces.

161
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,980
This doesn't look like normal pieces.

162
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:24,280
Well, I looked up how to cut up a chicken, but then some pieces are bigger and some are smaller, so I cut it up so it would be, you know, fair.

163
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,380
Oh.

164
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,140
What's that supposed to mean?

165
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,960
Nothing.

166
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,100
What?

167
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,840
Just that when you do your surgery rotation, I want to be in another state.

168
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,260
You wait.

169
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,280
Soon everyone will cut their chickens like this.

170
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,940
What about the people who want the skin left on?

171
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,960
Skin is overrated.

172
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:52,980
It's said to be marinated in Worcestershire sauce and butter, but we didn't have that, so I was going to use steak sauce, but we didn't have that, so I used ketchup.

173
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,800
It's pretty much the same, right?

174
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,640
We don't have butter either.

175
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,320
So I used butter-flavored popcorn oil.

176
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,220
Hey, it's butter-flavored.

177
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,560
Hi.

178
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,100
Hi.

179
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,600
Thank you for coming.

180
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,580
Thanks for having me.

181
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,360
Oh, of course.

182
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,780
Oh.

183
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,540
What's that smell?

184
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,680
Science.

185
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
Hiro, don't you have to be somewhere?

186
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,060
It's chicken.

187
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,380
I don't have to leave just yet.

188
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,360
I just had a taste for it, you know?

189
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,600
Uh-huh.

190
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,020
We haven't met.

191
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,780
I'm Hiroyuki, Kamal's roommate.

192
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,240
Hi.

193
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,000
Of course, it's not traditional coral food, not like you make.

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
Not like anyone makes.

195
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,000
My friend's just leaving.

196
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,160
Hey, I'm like the Surgeon General, man.

197
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,340
She should be warned.

198
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,040
Warned?

199
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,040
I had to make some substitutions in the recipe.

200
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,040
Oh.

201
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,400
Um, do you think it's done?

202
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,940
Well, stuff doesn't get brown in the microwave, right?

203
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,960
Maybe I could finish it on the stove.

204
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,620
We don't have a regular stove, and the flash doesn't work.

205
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,760
Ah.

206
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,320
Well…

207
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,220
Microwave it longer?

208
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,140
Sure.

209
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,190
Ah, few things in nature are as misunderstood as the playful Salmonella bacterium.

210
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:07,400
S.

211
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,700
typhi is the little dick in the…

212
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,200
Hiro, aren't you going to be late?

213
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,380
Tricky game moons.

214
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,500
You hit too hard, they stick.

215
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,500
Too soft, they skate.

216
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,780
Do it just right, and they obey your commands.

217
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,640
They work for you.

218
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Uh-huh.

219
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,960
Or you can slap them so hard they run for cover.

220
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,700
Bark at them.

221
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,060
And they just tickle them until you laugh.

222
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,640
Kiss them.

223
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,880
And they fall in love.

224
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,960
And if you shoot them, ate off the rag, played the kiss on the suicide bar,

225
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,820
backspin into the corner pocket, I say, shoot them…

226
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,260
They fly.

227
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,280
All day I was hoping you would take me for pizza.

228
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,300
Shut up!

229
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,400
Isn't it amazing how much soy pepperoni tastes like the real thing?

230
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,400
Do you eat pork?

231
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
If I did, my mother wouldn't know.

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,760
Yeah.

233
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,840
She'd be in bed for a week, she'd wear black, and not tell anybody why.

234
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,360
When I was a kid, my mother didn't care about that kind of thing.

235
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,020
After my sister died, she got way more strict.

236
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,460
What happened to your sister?

237
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,400
Genetic disorder.

238
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,460
It's funny, you know, when she was little, she was unstoppable.

239
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,420
I mean, the best you ever saw.

240
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,300
The best at what?

241
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:41,820
Everything.

242
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,020
Smartest, fastest, strongest, brattiest.

243
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,080
Oh, I don't know about that.

244
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,120
You should meet my little brother.

245
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,280
When she was four, I taught her to play backgammon.

246
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,920
I was eight.

247
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,420
I won the first two times we played, and then never again.

248
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,060
You must suck.

249
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,220
I'm nearly sure she could throw certain numbers when she wanted to.

250
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,280
The dice were loaded.

251
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,400
No, that's just how coordinated she was.

252
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,120
She could gauge the way they came out of her hand.

253
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,360
That's what I think.

254
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,600
Yeah, right.

255
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
Or maybe you just suck.

256
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,380
She loved languages.

257
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,420
She taught herself.

258
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,400
God, I hadn't thought about this in years.

259
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,520
She made Dad read bedtime stories every night,

260
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,760
and then she would pretend to go to sleep listening to a chatter channel hotwired to some other language.

261
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,240
And who set up those chatter programs for her?

262
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,100
It was easy.

263
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,360
I think your sister was very lucky.

264
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,860
She had a very active imagination, so like once a week she would completely terrify herself.

265
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,520
She would sneak into my room when she was supposed to be…

266
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,280
Talking you over and over and over again until you woke up.

267
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,620
Yeah.

268
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,120
Yeah, I told you I had a little brother.

269
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,500
The night before the accident, she had convinced herself there were bad guys or burglars creeping around outside our house.

270
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,840
I read her to sleep.

271
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,680
Last time I ever…

272
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,080
We don't have to talk about this.

273
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,520
It's okay.

274
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,060
I didn't mean to.

275
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,580
It's okay.

276
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,560
Anyway, by the time I woke up, she had already gone outside, and the thing had happened, and she was in the hospital.

277
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,560
And she was never right again.

278
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,080
I'm so sorry.

279
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,580
Do you want to tell me what happened?

280
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:19,020
She died from something called metabolic cascade failure, which is doctor speak for everything falls apart.

281
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,740
She couldn't talk when she got back from the hospital and couldn't walk a few weeks later.

282
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,300
Oh my God.

283
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,500
It took her a year to die.

284
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,440
Oh my God.

285
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,400
Your poor parents.

286
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,620
I used to take her out for walks.

287
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:37,300
I would push her wheelchair around to places we used to play, hit swings, and she didn't even work.

288
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,020
I guess me never lost anything.

289
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,620
Anything.

290
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,860
I just couldn't believe that she'd…

291
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,700
It wasn't your fault, Kamal.

292
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,500
Of course it wasn't.

293
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,740
But you felt guilty.

294
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,780
Yeah, but…

295
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,800
Like the doc said, why look back when the…

296
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:54,520
Don't.

297
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,520
Don't.

298
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,800
What?

299
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,500
Don't joke about it.

300
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,420
You don't have to do that with me.

301
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,520
She was six.

302
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,680
I was ten.

303
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,620
It was a long time ago.

304
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,540
Honestly, Sophia, it's not something I carry around with me every day.

305
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,400
Okay.

306
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,060
One question.

307
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:12,800
What?

308
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,460
When did you decide to be a doctor?

309
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,820
I don't know.

310
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,080
It just seemed like a good thing.

311
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:20,900
Oh.

312
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,260
Yeah.

313
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
You win, babysitter.

314
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,120
Here's your skin.

315
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,280
I live beneath Africa now.

316
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,900
There's someplace nobody ever goes.

317
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,040
It's the battery, Antarctica, or…

318
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,540
Indiana, for God's sake.

319
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,000
I keep waiting for the teary-eyed gratitude here.

320
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,360
You'll be waiting a while.

321
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,940
Hey, babysitter.

322
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,500
Yeah?

323
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,300
Maybe drop off a resume on your way out the door.

324
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,460
Good-looking crazy girls with guns.

325
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,920
I always got work for them.

326
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,500
Yeah, I'm more of an independent study girl.

327
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,240
I could teach you some things.

328
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,080
But it's your funeral.

329
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,180
Not yet.

330
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,360
Sooner than you think.

331
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,480
Is that a threat?

332
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,460
No, just experience.

333
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,100
I'm past 30.

334
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,280
I've been around forever.

335
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,980
Retirement comes sudden to people like you and me.

336
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,660
I am nothing like you.

337
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,260
We'll see.

338
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,100
Thanks for dinner, Kamal.

339
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,100
And next time you want chicken, you buy it and call me,

340
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,700
and I'll come over and cook it for you.

341
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,160
Deal.

342
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,400
Your hair's getting wet.

343
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,180
In fact, you're getting wet.

344
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,100
It feels good.

345
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,980
Dinner was great.

346
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,420
It's great being with someone from home.

347
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,340
Aiden will never understand you the way I do.

348
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,380
Aiden doesn't do understanding.

349
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,620
Aiden does charm.

350
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,920
Aiden does excitement.

351
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,380
He's not good for you, Soph.

352
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,860
That's the whole point.

353
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,180
But you're right.

354
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,660
Aiden isn't good for me.

355
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,780
In fact, he's probably with some girl right now.

356
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,380
Want me to check?

357
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:58,920
No.

358
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,740
Actually, he's not with some girl right now because of you.

359
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,580
And for that, you get a kiss.

360
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,620
You want to come inside?

361
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,740
Just for a minute.

362
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,000
Kamal.

363
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,660
You know that wouldn't be right.

364
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,800
Yeah.

365
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,520
You're a good friend, Kamal.

366
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,600
I really treasure that.

367
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,320
Yes, well…

368
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,000
No stars tonight.

369
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,720
If it wasn't raining, we might even be able to see our own sun.

370
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,500
Although there's probably too much ground light.

371
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,000
There's always too much ground light.

372
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,900
Good night, Kamal.

373
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,040
Good night, Sophia.

374
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,840
Hey, thanks.

375
00:14:59,680 --> 00:14:59,920
For what?

376
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,720
The lights and the music.

377
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,500
Chili is heated up.

378
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,120
Chili?

379
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,020
I was just thinking I'd have chili tonight.

380
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,660
You knew that?

381
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,240
No, but I analyzed your food-buying habits over the last seven months,

382
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,740
and chili seemed like a statistically robust option.

383
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,760
That's scary.

384
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,840
What's wrong?

385
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,700
It's not wrong.

386
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,620
It's just scary.

387
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,360
No.

388
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,900
When you came in, you seemed stressed.

389
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,500
Aw, man.

390
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,460
Tell me about it.

391
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,320
It's in my inbox.

392
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,880
I'm surprised you don't know about that.

393
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,300
I don't read your mail, Jersey.

394
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,720
You extrapolate my eating habits based on my grocery store purchases,

395
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,960
but you don't read my mail?

396
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,320
I respect your privacy.

397
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,520
I don't believe you.

398
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,580
You're smarter than people give you credit for.

399
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,120
Which people?

400
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,760
Tell me what's wrong.

401
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,680
I can help.

402
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,800
Don't even worry about it.

403
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,700
I got her under control.

404
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,480
How's your weekly soap opera going?

405
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,520
It's been a little frustrating this week following Kamal.

406
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,800
What is it with you and that guy?

407
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,460
Because he gave his chatter away.

408
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,580
I'm sending him another one, though.

409
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,040
You're sending him another one?

410
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,380
He won it in a raffle.

411
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
It's not like the guy doesn't know he didn't enter a raffle.

412
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,980
He didn't think he had until he found the ticket stubs in his account.

413
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,840
Jesus.

414
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,640
Time stamped five months ago to a night he bought a case of beer.

415
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,600
I never get cool stuff in the mail.

416
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,260
Oh, besides you.

417
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:10,820
Hmm.

418
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,620
Well, you'll like this.

419
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,820
Or you can slap them so hard they run for cover.

420
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,240
They bark at them.

421
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,780
And they just tickle them.

422
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,320
They laugh.

423
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,240
What is she doing?

424
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,880
Playing.

425
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,100
Oh, man.

426
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,220
Is she winning?

427
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,060
Kiss them.

428
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,080
And they fall in love.

429
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,120
She's winning.

430
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,800
So why does the IRS want to audit you?

431
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,860
You did read my mail.

432
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,440
No, but in scanning the rest of the country's mail.

433
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,600
Your name came up.

434
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,500
Taxes suck.

435
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,540
So don't pay them.

436
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,460
And spend a year sharing a cell with some guy named Spider?

437
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,400
No, thanks.

438
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,520
You won't go to jail.

439
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,420
You have me.

440
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,120
Derga?

441
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,640
Well, instead of owing them money, you could not owe them money.

442
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,540
Better yet, they could owe you.

443
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,340
They could owe you a lot.

444
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,640
No, you can't do that.

445
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,620
I'm pretty sure I can.

446
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,480
You're not going to.

447
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,460
I suspect I will.

448
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:10,900
Derga!

449
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,600
How much should we start with?

450
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,000
How about the gross planetary product of Ministo Colony?

451
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,400
Are you insane?

452
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,320
You know, I'm not quite sure how we could test that.

453
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,220
You can't channel tax money to me.

454
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,380
Taxes are for a reason.

455
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
I mean, roads, drinking water.

456
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,580
I'm sure you'd use it wisely.

457
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,720
Taxes paid for you.

458
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,060
I don't see you giving me back to the government.

459
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,160
Well, I should.

460
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,020
Hey, hey, what's wrong?

461
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,840
Why did the lights just flicker?

462
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,800
Josie, you're not going to give me back, are you?

463
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,860
No, no, I promise.

464
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,960
I won't give you back.

465
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,680
Good.

466
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,520
Why?

467
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,540
Why is it so important?

468
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,620
Because…

469
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,840
Because I like you.

470
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,820
Who doesn't?

471
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,460
But you don't know why you want to stay with me, do you?

472
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,980
There are things I want to do, and I…

473
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,860
It doesn't matter.

474
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,960
Anyway, about the auditor.

475
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,640
Jesus!

476
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,260
I could kill him.

477
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,340
Would that help?

478
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,260
No!

479
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,260
Okay.

480
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,080
Derga!

481
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,760
What?

482
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,480
I want you to promise me, repeat after me.

483
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,820
I, Derga, will not bankrupt the government.

484
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,180
Oh, okay.

485
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,660
I, Derga, will not bankrupt the government.

486
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,880
Either local or national.

487
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,720
Either local or national.

488
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,080
Or shuttle money into my accounts.

489
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,140
Or shuttle money into your accounts.

490
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,280
Or physically hurt or kill the auditor.

491
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,220
Damn!

492
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,540
I'm serious here.

493
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,060
So am I.

494
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,640
Just don't do anything weird at the audit, okay?

495
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,820
I won't divert funds.

496
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,300
I won't kill the auditor.

497
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,260
Or hurt him.

498
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,600
Or physically hurt him.

499
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,340
I'll take care of it.

500
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:46,800
How?

501
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,020
I'll take care of it.

502
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,080
It's a little early for wine, isn't it, sir?

503
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,520
On the contrary.

504
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,280
It's very nearly too late.

505
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,360
Do you know what you're sloshing around there, youngster?

506
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,700
That's a high house, alt burgundy 22.

507
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,300
Oh, please, sir.

508
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,940
Not the cranky old man.

509
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,760
And what's wrong with the cranky old man?

510
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,820
It's excruciating.

511
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,160
The old bastard's been very good to me over the years.

512
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,860
I know, sir.

513
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,820
Let's me shout without being noticed.

514
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,980
I know, sir.

515
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,280
I guess you jumped for joy when you heard you'd been transferred to me, huh?

516
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,960
I requested the posting, sir.

517
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,640
You did?

518
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,320
Yes, sir.

519
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,020
Why?

520
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,540
It's hard to recall, sir.

521
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,900
All right.

522
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,860
I deserve that.

523
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,560
Yes, sir.

524
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,580
Here's your drink.

525
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,720
You've never had an alt burgundy, lieutenant?

526
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,760
No, sir.

527
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,640
You know why?

528
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,340
I don't drink.

529
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,440
They don't make it anymore.

530
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,640
Regrettable, sir.

531
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,060
Perhaps the scent, tar, is it, sir, was not to everyone's taste.

532
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,540
They don't make it because alt burgundy comes from Jericho 7.

533
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,800
Oh.

534
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,620
Cain.

535
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm sorry, sir.

536
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,420
Oh, hell, you weren't even born.

537
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,700
Pour yourself a drink, lieutenant.

538
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,460
I don't…

539
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,040
very well, sir.

540
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,580
Here's to Jericho that fell and to Sigma Octanus 4 that did not.

541
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,900
Here, here, sir.

542
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,480
Well, it's not to everybody's taste.

543
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,760
No, sir.

544
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,660
Shortly before they turned for home, the Apocalypse, heavily cloaked and posted deep in Covenant space,

545
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,140
began experiencing some slight but troubling anomalies with their computer systems.

546
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:41,100
Just as her captain decided to bring her home, long-range sensors detected a curious object adrift in space.

547
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,220
Where did you get this?

548
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,380
I read the reports.

549
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,260
None of this is in here.

550
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,280
The object was roughly the size of a tire, a Covenant artifact of a completely new design,

551
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,640
unlike anything we've seen before, and frankly pretty inscrutable.

552
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,340
I talked to the Apocalypse's captain, that's how.

553
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,300
Where are the records?

554
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,360
Oh, surely the blast that knocked the ship out of the slipstream

555
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,660
and took down the whole planet's comm channels erased all the computer records.

556
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,280
Except that's not what you think.

557
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,520
Of course it is.

558
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,100
You think the records have been erased?

559
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,220
Not at all.

560
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,140
By someone from Section 3, someone like Standish.

561
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,300
Harris the thought.

562
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,020
We should talk to the captain again, sir.

563
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,720
Get her to corroborate the official version.

564
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,740
She's dead.

565
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,740
Oh.

566
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,760
Some accident involving a bus, unluckiest thing in the world.

567
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,780
You don't think…

568
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,580
even if there was something important on the Apocalypse, something crucial to the war effort?

569
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,240
Like a new piece of Covenant technology capable of crippling an entire solar system's CNC channels?

570
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,080
Although, if you're right about Troy…

571
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,220
Harmony.

572
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,120
Harmony is the instructive one.

573
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:37,840
Oh.

574
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,760
What are you going to do?

575
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,940
Under the circumstances, I think I'll have another drink.
