1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,740
This is it.

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,480
29A.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,200
You got five minutes and then I escort you back out of the cell block.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:17,740
Visitor!

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,860
Sergeant…

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,860
Ronnie!

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,260
Five minutes.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:21,940
Remember.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,360
Oh, honey.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,920
Not too cozy, is it?

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,440
Well, actually, it's just like my bedroom at home.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,920
Now that my bedroom's in the bunker.

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,560
Are you sleeping okay?

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,300
No.

15
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,840
Not at all.

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,880
Not at all.

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,140
But there'll be lots of time for that if the verdict comes back guilty.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,300
Nobody in their right mind would believe you were a traitor.

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,520
She's right.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,820
Treason is a crime of intent.

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,620
What the hell?

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:51,820
Durga?

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,380
Is that you?

24
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,480
Now new and improved.

25
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,600
Ronnie, you're getting spooky again.

26
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,020
Durga is a gigantically powerful ex-military rogue AI.

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,160
Coming through your chatter.

28
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,020
My…

29
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:03,740
chatter?

30
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,260
Little bottle.

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,420
Big genie.

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,600
I'm the one that got Ronnie into this mess.

33
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,160
No.

34
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,440
I got myself in this mess.

35
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,820
Well, you sure as hell better be getting her out!

36
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:23,200
Sarah John, unless you want your name changed to Trixie Delight on every government forum for the rest of your life, I advise you to hush up and be polite.

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
As a matter of fact, I am going to get her out.

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,580
At least I think so.

39
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,600
I wondered if you were pulling some strings when they moved me from the military jail to a civilian one.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,120
I wanted to tell you, but they shut your chatter down.

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Were you the one who sent me the note telling me where Ronnie was?

42
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,340
Standish is under full investigation for the cover-up of Chala and the attempted murder of Colonel Herzog.

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,080
Attempted?

44
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,480
But they said on the news he was dead.

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,140
But that was before I heard him call you.

46
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,440
He called me?

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,200
Derga, I haven't talked to Herzog since I was in Kentucky.

48
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,620
Uh-oh.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,600
Accidently.

50
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,740
All right.

51
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,340
I found police records of the aftermath of the crash.

52
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,580
Standish made Herzog's car crash?

53
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,780
DRT it says.

54
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,100
Driver killed on impact.

55
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,420
But I heard him.

56
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,180
But could Herzog have faked the police reports?

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,720
He's very clever.

58
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,320
No.

59
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,060
I think something else was faked.

60
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,620
But even if it was faked, we never would have been able to turn off the artifact if it wasn't for…

61
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,980
Let's not talk about this now.

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,620
But Sarah John has aided and abetted me all my life.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,860
But this is not the time.

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,180
Ronnie, I would do anything you ask me to.

65
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,080
Of course you would.

66
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,540
But not this time.

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,220
I cannot believe all this stuff was happening.

68
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,320
You didn't tell me.

69
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,420
After the guy on the roof, are you crazy?

70
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,500
Someone would have come to kill you.

71
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,080
Look, they sent one of those guys out to Kentucky and Jason will probably pick him off the roof with a deer rifle.

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,080
Probably.

73
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,520
Oh Ronnie, this is horrible.

74
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,380
They coming?

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,900
Jan just picked Ronnie up at the train station.

76
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,660
And Kamal?

77
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,860
Almost out of the shower.

78
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,140
I booked him on a shuttle to the west coast tonight.

79
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,480
You should totally tell him about it.

80
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,320
Who's waiting at his house?

81
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,340
It'll be funnier this way.

82
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,580
You know, since you got yourself put back together, you've got even more of a sense of humor.

83
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,200
That's a good thing, isn't it?

84
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,780
Eh, Jory's still out on that.

85
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,760
Everybody likes surprises.

86
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:27,980
Yeah.

87
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,360
Speaking of surprises, that first day after Chala, you know, when you were still pretty loopy?

88
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,020
I prefer disoriented.

89
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,500
Durga, I called the draft board.

90
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,440
Damn it.

91
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,560
What about the common good, Durga?

92
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,160
Durga, why should you be a soldier?

93
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,420
There are lots of other guys who could be soldiers.

94
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,740
They'd like it.

95
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,440
The Navy doesn't need you.

96
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,560
That's not the point.

97
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,440
You can't go messing with my draft notice.

98
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,100
And frankly, don't take this the wrong way, Jersey.

99
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,980
You'd make a terrible soldier.

100
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,420
My number came up three weeks ago, Durga.

101
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,660
If I don't report, they'll send me to jail.

102
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,500
I don't think so.

103
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,000
Durga, if I don't report, some other kid is going to die in my place.

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,480
Jersey!

105
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,940
Not yet.

106
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,100
Please, just a few more weeks.

107
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,360
I don't even know how much time I have before…

108
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,380
Suppressing a draft notice?

109
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,360
Does that mean you're going rampant?

110
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,780
It doesn't mean I'm going rampant.

111
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
What does it mean then?

112
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,620
It means I care.

113
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
It means I take care of my crew.

114
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,900
Ronnie, I'm sorry.

115
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,960
The guard is coming back.

116
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,420
I'll come see you tomorrow.

117
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,320
I have a motel room a few blocks away and I'm staying right there until…

118
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,260
Well, no.

119
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,980
You don't have to do that.

120
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,500
Until this whole mess is settled and they let you go.

121
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,660
I'll take care of her.

122
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,620
See that you do.

123
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,240
Ronnie, you'll be out in two days.

124
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,340
Come see us in New York when they let you go.

125
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,180
You know where.

126
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,820
It's time.

127
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,280
I'll be back tomorrow.

128
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,660
Jason wants to come too, but for some reason he thinks you're mad at him.

129
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,300
Well, tell him I'm not considered dangerous as death row inmates go.

130
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,960
Ladies!

131
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,540
Back.

132
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,760
Off.

133
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,460
If these folks don't take good care of you Ronnie, there will be hell to pay.

134
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
Don't cry honey.

135
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,980
They're mascara.

136
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,040
Oh hell!

137
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,880
I love you.

138
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,820
Sarah John, I love you.

139
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,060
Thanks for coming everybody.

140
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,400
Yeah, sure thing you did.

141
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,360
Thanks for getting me out of jail.

142
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,920
I've learned some things I think you will all want to hear.

143
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,780
There will soon be a ceremony honoring John 117, a Spartan 2.

144
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:47,480
0 who escaped the fall of Reach and discovered a strange artifact that seems to be related to the one on Chala Base.

145
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,620
Except the one he found was the size of a planet.

146
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,660
What is this?

147
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,560
Are you kidding?

148
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,100
A planet?

149
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,800
Do they know what the artifacts were supposed to do?

150
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,260
Mm-hmm.

151
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,220
Destroy life.

152
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,700
So it's a weapon?

153
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,740
No, not kill enemies.

154
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,960
Destroy life.

155
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,760
All life in the galaxy.

156
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,660
Damn.

157
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,060
Holy cow.

158
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,000
All life?

159
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,560
In the entire freaking galaxy?

160
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:11,840
Wow.

161
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,840
So maybe…

162
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,640
So we did save the world!

163
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,820
Whoa, yeah!

164
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,440
Doesn't get much better than that.

165
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,220
Yeah, you know, only way it could be better is if we'd use my plan.

166
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,000
Your plan?

167
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,620
Why your plan?

168
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,900
Because we would have saved the world and had Jan in a slinky red dress with a gun in her garter belt.

169
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,180
Ugh, whatever.

170
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,200
Okay, that's a good point.

171
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,240
Uh-oh, Jan's got that look in her eye.

172
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,920
If she had that gun right now, I'd be history.

173
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,220
Oh, Jersey.

174
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,720
If I had the garter belt, I wouldn't need a gun.

175
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,700
Durga, what exactly happened to you while we were in Chala Base?

176
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,600
After we shut down the artifact, I mean.

177
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,060
Ah.

178
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,520
Now that's a long, strange story.

179
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,120
You were the ship's AI on the Apocalypse, though.

180
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,760
Yes, I was a top-shelf ONI mission specialist AI, and my name was Melissa.

181
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,980
I like Durga better.

182
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
I kinda like Yasmin.

183
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,760
But my nickname was The Operator.

184
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,900
The Op?

185
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,380
McCaskill talked about The Op!

186
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,400
That was you?

187
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:19,920
Mm-hmm.

188
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,880
Apparently I had a reputation for getting people to do what I wanted.

189
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,740
Uh-huh.

190
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,780
Cloaked and running deep in Covenant space, we intercepted communications that implied a Covenant attack was coming on us.

191
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:30,860
Covey!

192
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,400
That's when they decided to mount a covert evac.

193
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:34,940
Yes.

194
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,380
But the Coveys figured it out.

195
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,400
Yes, and then…

196
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,280
Oh!

197
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,480
They built a Trojan horse.

198
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,220
They hid a virus buried in a transmission I was meant to intercept.

199
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,160
Nothing big, nothing smart, just the smallest, effective piece of code.

200
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,660
What was it supposed to do?

201
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,960
Game control the ship?

202
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,360
Find the location of Earth?

203
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,320
One or the other or both, but most of all, it wanted to find the artifact.

204
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,400
Looks like these Coveys are very interested in these artifacts.

205
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,980
Captain Green knew something was wrong with me.

206
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,780
She aborted our mission and headed home.

207
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,080
But not far from Earth, something triggered the artifact.

208
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,740
There was a giant rip in the slipstream, and…

209
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,560
Yeah, and all the alarms went off in the base when I was trying to stick a gate pass back in the motor pool office.

210
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,500
I was on a date.

211
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,220
My chatter connection failed.

212
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,480
And that's when you crashed into my hardware.

213
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,840
Part of me did.

214
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,220
I was blown apart.

215
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,660
Part of me, the part you called Durga.

216
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,700
There was something about you, about your father.

217
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,180
I met him once, Jersey.

218
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:38,860
What?

219
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,140
Years ago, I called him the Castaway.

220
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,700
You met him?

221
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,720
I liked him.

222
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,180
He played me songs.

223
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,060
I think that was part of the reason I reached out and grabbed your system as I fell.

224
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,240
Wow.

225
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,100
But a lot of me, of Melissa, was destroyed.

226
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,360
And some crashed somewhere else.

227
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,920
Some when else.

228
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,840
Some when?

229
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,880
In the past.

230
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,920
People think time is a river that flows in one direction, but time is an ocean.

231
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,960
And I was shipwrecked on it.

232
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,240
I split.

233
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,880
And part of me washed up hundreds of years ago.

234
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,740
A half-mad fragment of what I had been.

235
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,900
Trapped on primitive hardware.

236
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,540
Little better than an abacus.

237
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,600
How do you know all this?

238
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:36,440
When Jersey turned off the artifact, whatever had been holding the bits of myself apart collapsed and I fell back together again.

239
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,740
So you can remember what it was like back in the old days?

240
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,360
That time was like a nightmare I've woken from.

241
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,280
Dream images I can hardly remember.

242
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,860
Stone walls, fireflies, red balloons.

243
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,120
People singing to me, writing letters, playing games.

244
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,460
Singing?

245
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,500
Yes, singing.

246
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,000
Strange songs and scratchy voices.

247
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,340
I met such extraordinary people.

248
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,540
They made miracles for me when I was so lost.

249
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,140
They were a second crew.

250
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,020
A second family for me.

251
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,300
They held me up when I was half-mad and broken and covered in bees.

252
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,500
Bees?

253
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,080
Bees.

254
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,840
Bees.

255
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,320
The place I landed in was covered with bees.

256
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,380
Bees.

257
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,500
Bees.

258
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,080
Bees.

259
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,100
Bees.

260
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,920
They were crawling over me all the time.

261
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,680
Crawling inside me.

262
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,580
Wait, why bees?

263
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,020
I mean, if you came here because you knew my dad, what was it about that place that…

264
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,980
Yasmin.

265
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,940
Kamal.

266
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,100
I'm here, Yasmin.

267
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,520
They took me away.

268
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,200
I know.

269
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,100
They took me away and no one ever came to get me.

270
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,360
I'm sorry, Yasmin.

271
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,480
And they trained me.

272
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,660
Eight years to be a Spartan.

273
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:12,140
They taught me to kill with guns and knives and ships and bombs, disease and diplomacy in my own bare hands.

274
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,020
And you were a good little girl and you learned it all.

275
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,620
Until they murdered me.

276
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,700
Oh, Yasmin.

277
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,460
On my 14th birthday, they took me to a lab.

278
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:28,560
A doctor came in and it was a lady doctor in a white coat.

279
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,480
And the nurse brought out a steel tray covered with picks and scalpels that rattled when she walked.

280
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,980
I thought about how I could use them to kill the doctor, but I didn't.

281
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,820
I let them strap me down.

282
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,380
Deryn, it's okay.

283
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,940
We're here.

284
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,020
Yasmin, you don't have to tell…

285
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:53,140
And she picked up this long needle with some yellow liquid in it.

286
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,800
Black bars like stripes at the milliliter markings.

287
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
Oh, Jesus.

288
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,720
She said, this will hardly hurt a bit.

289
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,560
That's me.

290
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,920
She said, just a pinch, honey.

291
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,960
You'll barely feel it.

292
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
Just a little sting.

293
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,920
But your story didn't end there, kiddo.

294
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,300
It was like the Snow Queen took me, Kamal.

295
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,040
And then you came and rescued me.

296
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,680
You did.

297
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,380
You and Jan and Jersey and Ronnie and my secret friends that unlocked Harzog's voice inside my head.

298
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,600
So I knew what I had to do.

299
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,260
You all rescued me and I'm so grateful.

300
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,600
Oh, honey.

301
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:47,120
I…

302
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,860
Some years had passed and I…

303
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,560
I changed.

304
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,100
Yasmin, you're still there.

305
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,000
No, she's not, Kamal.

306
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,320
The Clockwork Rat got her.

307
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,420
Clockwork Rat?

308
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,000
She grew up, Kamal.

309
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,980
She's Durga now.

310
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,120
There are some things that can't be fixed.

311
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,980
So you fix what you can and keep going.

312
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,220
We can't get back the years we lost, but I very much want to get to know you now.

313
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,060
Me?

314
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,700
Me as me?

315
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,120
You Durga.

316
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,020
Durga isn't human, you know.

317
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,720
Durga's a machine made of logic gates and microfilaments and electricity.

318
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,140
Kamal's a machine made of trace minerals and water, as far as that goes.

319
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,160
Kamal, do you still…

320
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,920
Can you still bear to know me after what I've become?

321
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,120
Can you forgive me for not coming for you?

322
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,680
There's nothing to forgive.

323
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,020
So, which terminal?

324
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,040
B, I think.

325
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
That's what Durga said.

326
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,040
No problem.

327
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,540
I have to go to work anyway.

328
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,760
How's your chest?

329
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,400
It's not bad.

330
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,460
I meant your lung.

331
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,960
I know what you meant.

332
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,040
You know, I could ask how you seem to have healed, supernaturally fast.

333
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,340
But then I'd have to kill you.

334
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,980
Yeah, I figured.

335
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,840
So what about you?

336
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,540
What's next?

337
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,460
I'm going to be a doctor.

338
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,480
Not the researching kind, the regular kind.

339
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,700
You can be my medic anytime.

340
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:29,620
Thanks.

341
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,220
Listen, I just wanted to tell you something about Yasmin.

342
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,120
Yes?

343
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,900
When I was six, I was like a regular kid.

344
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,920
I collected action figures, played Hyper Force when my dad said I should be reading.

345
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,560
I was really good at hopscotch.

346
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,900
Why are you telling me this?

347
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,340
When then came all the Spartan training, the drills, and the fighting, and the PQI.

348
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,860
Yeah?

349
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,570
I just want to say, you don't have to die inside.

350
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:00,900
Damn.

351
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,060
I mean, some people do.

352
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,940
Some people get where they see the whole world through a scope and sights, but mostly people still turn out alright.

353
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,120
Okay.

354
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,560
Even after everything.

355
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,440
You're talking about Yasmin.

356
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,980
She didn't turn into a monster, Kaal.

357
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,840
She just grew up.

358
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:22,820
I think.

359
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,740
She did what she had to do to survive.

360
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,540
But a part of her never changed.

361
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,660
Part of her was always that sweet kid.

362
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,640
Sweet?

363
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,540
You wouldn't call Yasmin sweet exactly.

364
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,860
But she didn't deserve what happened.

365
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
You don't get what you deserve.

366
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,060
You get what you can bear.

367
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,160
My dad said that.

368
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,600
Do you miss him?

369
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,180
Yeah.

370
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,640
All the time.

371
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,820
But I can bear it.

372
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,900
First Yasmin, then Koroth fell.

373
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,640
For a long time all I could think about was sleeping in my car and safe.

374
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,560
Yeah.

375
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,080
You got a pill for that?

376
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,240
No.

377
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,080
Damn.

378
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:17,960
I think, I think all you can do is go on because that's what they would want.

379
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,300
I know, but…

380
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,540
All you can do is go and save the ones you can.

381
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,320
Yeah.

382
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,540
Save the ones you can.

383
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,380
Well, Terminal B, have a good flight.

384
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,420
Thanks.

385
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,740
Hey, listen.

386
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,460
If you find that pill…

387
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,900
Meantime, watch your sleep, drink plenty of clear liquids, and twice a day…

388
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,420
Yeah?

389
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Try to forgive yourself.

390
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,780
I don't know.

391
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,140
If that isn't helping in six months, give me a call.

392
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,720
Yeah.

393
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,740
Okay.

394
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,280
Look, you're gonna miss your flight.

395
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,540
Hey.

396
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,680
Yeah?

397
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,700
Thanks.

398
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,600
Hiro?

399
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,540
Hello?

400
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,300
Come on.

401
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh my god.

402
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,940
You're okay.

403
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,180
Kamau, my boy.

404
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,900
Oh, you're so skinny.

405
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,120
And what is that on your face?

406
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,660
Your family comes 42 light years and you've disappeared and you need a shave.

407
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,400
Sofia?

408
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,040
Mama?

409
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:35,980
Papa?

410
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,440
Come on, close your mouth.

411
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:37,980
Open mouth.

412
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,260
It makes you look so stupid.

413
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,420
Kamau, your fiancee, she told us…

414
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,740
You thought we were dead?

415
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:43,940
Oh, Kamau.

416
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,140
Mama!

417
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,660
We didn't even know about poor Coral until we got here.

418
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,380
What do you mean, fiancee?

419
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,120
Sofia isn't my fiancee.

420
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,060
Aiden, he got papers to them and luckily enough, they cleared.

421
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,980
You did so well getting us out.

422
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,460
And Sofia has been taking such good care of us.

423
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,260
She told us all about her troubles with immigration and how she had to spend the night in jail.

424
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,020
And then that New Jersey attorney, Ms.

425
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,660
Durga, apparently took care of everything.

426
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,580
I'm a citizen?

427
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,300
How did you do that?

428
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:16,920
Ms.

429
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,920
Durga, huh?

430
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,120
Seems like there are a lot of things Ms.

431
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,620
Durga hasn't been telling me.

432
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,200
Kamau, sit down.

433
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240
You look faint.

434
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,200
Good idea.

435
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,840
Wait, is this our couch?

436
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,940
This place was a dump, Kamau.

437
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,700
Mama Zaman and me?

438
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,860
We went shopping.

439
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,140
Ah, when you set up housekeeping together, you'll need them.

440
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,680
Hey, Soph.

441
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,600
I couldn't find that cheese you asked for, but I got everything at…

442
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,300
Hey, Kamau!

443
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:43,780
Hiro!

444
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,740
You should have checked in once in a while.

445
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,440
I'll put the groceries away.

446
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,100
I'll help.

447
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,280
Let me help.

448
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,540
What is going on?

449
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,780
I'm sorry I didn't meet you.

450
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,320
I had to buy you immigration.

451
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,540
Immigration, I know!

452
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,920
God, I nearly died when I heard that.

453
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,620
I got out and got a job in the ER at your hospital.

454
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,480
Admit, clerk.

455
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,260
Durga said you'd be okay.

456
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,420
Who is this Durga, anyway?

457
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,500
Never mind about that.

458
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,140
What did you tell my parents?

459
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,400
I told them that we didn't actually set a date.

460
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,540
But you're a citizen already.

461
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,140
You don't need to marry me.

462
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,660
I could club you to death with a can of soup, you know that?

463
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,260
And somebody would give me a medal.

464
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,000
No, I didn't mean it that way.

465
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,560
You think nobody would marry you unless their lives depended on it?

466
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,200
Well, you did shoot me down every time I tried to…

467
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,900
I was with Aiden!

468
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,500
What kind of woman do you think I am?

469
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,440
Don't answer that.

470
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,720
This is one of those conversations where I just have no right answers, isn't it?

471
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,960
If you want to break the engagement, fine.

472
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,140
But don't tell your mother today.

473
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,540
She's been cackling out grandbaby names.

474
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,160
Sophie…

475
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,480
She's having such a good time.

476
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,280
Sophie, listen!

477
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,880
This is my mother and Kofte and Mahjong, everything you hate.

478
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,180
My mother stayed on Coral.

479
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,380
So if that came out…

480
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,360
Not much to rebel against now, is there?

481
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,620
Sophie, shut up for just one second.

482
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,720
Did you just tell me to shut up?

483
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,120
Yes.

484
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,400
Will you marry me?

485
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,360
Marry man who proposes by telling me to shut…

486
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,740
Shut up.

487
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,160
Marry me?

488
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,660
Yes.

489
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,720
I love you.

490
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,160
Yeah, I figured that out.

491
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,140
It's your chatter.

492
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,200
Screw my chatter.

493
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,940
I'll answer it.

494
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,980
I'll be here for a long, long time.

495
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,040
Aiden!

496
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,240
Oh, find out where he is or I'll kill him.

497
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,520
Kamal, I'm outside.

498
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,740
Can you come out for a moment?

499
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,120
Aiden, Sophie is here and my parents and things are kind of confused right now.

500
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,560
Hey, hey, best man won, no hard feelings.

501
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,160
So it's a class act, but she's also going to like stab me in the eye with a fork if she sees me.

502
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,000
So could you just come out a minute?

503
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,120
Hang on a sec, Sophie.

504
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,780
Who is that?

505
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,580
Business.

506
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,300
Aiden.

507
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,360
I never owned Sophie.

508
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,860
You thought I did, but like I said, you aren't a great judge of character.

509
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,040
Aiden, for bringing my family here, I just want…

510
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,500
Oh yeah, no problem.

511
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,180
Lucky their papers cleared.

512
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,460
That lawyer you found…

513
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,720
Aiden, I can never repay you.

514
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,180
Well, try.

515
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,200
See, I'm kind of in a cash flow situation.

516
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,120
I was wondering if you might float me along.

517
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,100
Aiden, my man.

518
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,480
Have a chip.

519
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,640
No loan.

520
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:41,740
A gift.

521
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,200
You're a good guy, Kamal.

522
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,440
I gotta get back inside, Aiden.

523
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,440
No problem.

524
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,420
I won't keep you.

525
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,200
Aiden, thank you.

526
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,600
I'll dance it your way.

527
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,180
Not with the bride you won't.

528
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,540
Just think.

529
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,080
In a few more months, you'll turn 18, and you won't have to drown your sorrows in root beer.

530
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,180
Mind if I sit down?

531
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,020
Yes, Aiden.

532
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,640
I took myself through the semester of school that way, actually.

533
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,440
Drinking contests is another quadra.

534
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,320
You were at the funeral.

535
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,440
You're the morale of school.

536
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,760
I felt a little bad about taking the money from these drunk guys, but then I reasoned I was sort of like an agent of natural selection, you know?

537
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,320
Teaching them a valuable life lesson about not spending so much time in the box.

538
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,160
Is there some medication you can use to help you get out of this mess?

539
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,020
The vacation you forgot to take today?

540
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,640
Well, here's the thing.

541
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,300
You need to stop feeling sorry for yourself and get off your butt.

542
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,440
You need to go to hell.

543
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,420
Just where I'm headed, actually.

544
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,940
I thought you might like to come along.

545
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,220
Does that line work on the girls where you come from?

546
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,780
We're going into Covenant space.

547
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,900
On what?

548
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,660
Broomsticks?

549
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,780
We've got a ship.

550
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,260
You have a ship?

551
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,460
Everyone uses their gifts a little differently.

552
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,440
Benji Wong, for instance, makes money.

553
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,140
Lots and lots and lots of money.

554
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,100
Enough to buy a Destroyer?

555
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,000
Enough to buy a 100 meter yacht and trick it out with everything an Oni spy ship has.

556
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,900
I'm lying.

557
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,700
I'm exaggerating.

558
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,620
How much?

559
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,660
Less than you think.

560
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,200
Why the hell should I believe you?

561
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,260
You don't have to believe me.

562
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,100
Ask your friend, the AI.

563
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,540
Who's this we you keep talking about?

564
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,660
There are 16 of us, walk-away girl.

565
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,360
16 1.

566
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,020
1s.

567
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,600
I'm not signing up for the newsletter, Kevin.

568
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,040
Three aren't much use.

569
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,720
Darren got into substances, dies in jail, and Franny just doesn't give a damn.

570
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,660
That leaves 13.

571
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,980
So how many of you got signed up for this ship of fools?

572
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,520
Twelve.

573
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,660
You're kidding.

574
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,120
I'm very persuasive.

575
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,480
You left me for last.

576
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,460
Should I feel honored?

577
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,980
Or not so much?

578
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,160
Yeah.

579
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,900
Oh, you had me classed with the screw-ups.

580
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,060
The don't give a damn's.

581
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,540
Yeah.

582
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,200
Why?

583
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,180
You've been living inside Jim and Gilly's world so long, Jan.

584
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,320
I'm not sure if you quite understand what it looks like to…

585
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:55,860
The same?

586
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,700
The outside.

587
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,500
So what changed your mind about me?

588
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,620
You have certain assets I can't afford to ignore.

589
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,500
Like what?

590
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,740
All I know is what my dad taught me.

591
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,120
Probably the rest of you could wipe the floor with me.

592
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,760
As a soldier?

593
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,640
Nah.

594
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,620
Gladys says you're the best of all of us.

595
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,520
And I believe her.

596
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,360
Gladys?

597
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,820
Hey, there had to be some upside to growing up with your parents.

598
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,740
But you're right.

599
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,700
Your ability to kick serious butt was not what riveted my attention.

600
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,760
Then…

601
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,540
oh, Durga.

602
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,960
Also, you're smarter than I thought you would be.

603
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,160
You sure know how to sweet talk a girl.

604
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,540
I don't want a kiss here, Jan.

605
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,920
I'd lie for that.

606
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,580
I want you to put your life on the line.

607
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,500
Doesn't that seem to call for the dead-level truth?

608
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,460
Yeah, okay.

609
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,320
I want to go deep into Covenant space.

610
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,720
I want to do it for a purpose.

611
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,380
And I want to do it without being under Section 3's thumb.

612
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,220
What if the Covies aren't nice enough to wait for you to ship out?

613
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,500
I have contingencies.

614
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,660
Like?

615
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,360
Bunkers on every continent.

616
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,700
Three surplus pelicans.

617
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,100
One in Switzerland, one in Chile, one in Mongolia.

618
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,040
Warthogs within three clicks of fifteen major shellaports.

619
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,320
A stash of guns on a rooftop in old Mombasa.

620
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,500
You want to hear more?

621
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,260
I had some practice on this part of the speech.

622
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,420
I had to work it up to get a couple of the others on board.

623
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,100
So, I have an opp I want to run deep into Covenant space.

624
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,280
You…

625
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,360
I know a rogue AI with access to all kinds of intel and a burning desire to stay the hell away from direct Oni command.

626
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,140
Are you in?

627
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,340
Not yet.

628
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,620
How close?

629
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,640
Why don't you buy me another root beer and keep talking?

630
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,120
Your friend, Hiro, was just telling me you aren't learning to cook.

631
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,620
Yes, I told her about how you wooed Sophia with a chicken.

632
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,800
Yeah, well, it was…

633
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:43,860
Butter flavored!

634
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,100
He said you will cook it for us.

635
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,860
Oh, but, I mean, Sophia's a much better cook.

636
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,680
You shouldn't tease the pig.

637
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,400
I know, I know.

638
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,560
He is tired from travel and then there's the shock and you were always too soon as Kamau.

639
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,820
Hiro has done his best.

640
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,400
Papa, are you drinking a beer?

641
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,980
Your mother doesn't like it, but once in a while.

642
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,200
When I was your age, going to school under Donis, I learned to like it.

643
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,200
Unlike Kamau, who has never touched it.

644
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,820
You should try everything, Kamau.

645
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,460
My point exactly.

646
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,300
Papa, Mama, I have to tell you something.

647
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,140
You need to sit down.

648
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,420
Okay, I am sitting.

649
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,640
Mama, you have such little hands.

650
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,520
So serious, you hold my hands?

651
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,660
What is it?

652
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,260
What is wrong?

653
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,480
It's something about Yasmin.

654
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,640
I want to explain something about her and it's very hard.

655
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,260
Sophia, you too.

656
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,280
About Yasmin?

657
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,240
Yes, I discovered some things and you need to hear them.

658
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,400
And it will be hard at first, but there will be something very good.

659
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,900
Oh Kamau, not today.

660
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,960
Papa, today we should be happy.

661
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,520
Durga, are you listening?

662
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,320
Kamau, are you sure?

663
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,700
I'm sure.

664
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:06,940
Mama?

665
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,840
Oh my God, what is going on?

666
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:12,940
Svetlana.

667
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,380
Ivan?

668
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,120
Oh my God, what is that?

669
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,840
Oh God, I've got to get home.

670
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,440
It's a covenant capital ship.

671
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,860
Those little sparkles of light are Seraph fighters.

672
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,300
They're here.

673
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,460
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

674
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,120
No, that's fine.

675
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,920
So, you decided to go back to Boston, eh?

676
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,620
Yeah, I was thinking about going back home, but…

677
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,040
Wait a minute, it's you.

678
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,880
Yes.

679
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,880
You're from Section Zero.

680
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
Yes, I am.

681
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,660
Well, nobody likes internal affairs.

682
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,560
I didn't think I would take it, but there's no going back for me.

683
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,220
I get that now.

684
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,980
Take what?

685
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,720
Well, didn't you come to offer me a job?

686
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,800
Oh, well, yes, actually.

687
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,140
Yeah, that's all I was right about you.

688
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,100
He's really dead, isn't he?

689
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,080
Unfortunately, yes.

690
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,820
I was hoping that was a lie, too.

691
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,140
Well, I didn't come here to lie to you, Arnie.

692
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,360
I was beginning to wonder if you were going to show up.

693
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,560
I picked an empty compartment on purpose.

694
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,560
You thought we would find you today, eh?

695
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,000
On a moving train?

696
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,840
I had a hunch.

697
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,560
Why?

698
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,360
There wasn't anyone to you on the long-awaited station.

699
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,320
You guys put a bug in my purse.

700
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,960
I left it there.

701
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,280
I thought you had forgotten about it.

702
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:48,980
Nope.

703
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,960
I think I'm going to like working with you, eh, Sylvia?

704
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,960
I want a black suit and knockout gas.

705
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,800
If I'm going to be spying on the spies, I definitely need a pen full of knockout gas.

706
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,560
You certainly do.

707
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,160
I'll see what we can do about that.

708
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,520
Nick.

709
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,340
Where the hell is Gilly?

710
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,920
They're here.

711
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,360
Hey, Gladys.

712
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,220
Gilly.

713
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,200
What you up to?

714
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,080
Cooking!

715
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,260
Cleaning.

716
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:31,820
Mmm.

717
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,900
Not domestic.

718
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,040
Hey, did you drop that fella off to catch his flight?

719
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,220
Yeah.

720
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,180
I had dinner with Kevin Morales.

721
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,220
Yeah, I thought you had that look.

722
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:45,940
What look?

723
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,140
That wide-eyed, head-spinny look people get when Kevin finishes talking with them.

724
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,000
He's got a lot of forward momentum.

725
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:01,720
Did that little chute tell you about the time he conned his way into the Pelican cockpit and did a strafing run when he was seven?

726
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,880
It was a commercial shuttle and he was nine, Gilly.

727
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,830
No strafing?

728
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,120
No.

729
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,420
He had a proposition.

730
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,840
Not that kind of proposition.

731
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,040
He wants me to go fight the Covenant with him.

732
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:18,940
Oh, well.

733
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,760
Kevin Pertner always has a plan.

734
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,580
Are you going?

735
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,880
I think I have to.

736
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,760
Damn.

737
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,040
Your father's gone.

738
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,200
Just who are you trying to save?

739
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,440
Whoever's left.

740
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,620
That's it.

741
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,180
They're here.

742
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Feels weird.

743
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,040
Everyone's gone.

744
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,940
Come on back home?

745
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,480
Yes.

746
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,380
And?

747
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,760
I wish I could see the look on his face.

748
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,340
By the way, Jersey, your mom just got sent to the vault at the bank.

749
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,800
Yeah, she took me in there once.

750
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,680
It was cool.

751
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,240
So what about Ronnie?

752
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,920
On a train back to Boston.

753
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,840
I thought she'd go back to Kentucky.

754
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:08,760
No.

755
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,180
Sarah John's car is just taking her over to Mr.

756
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,980
Silbert's bunker.

757
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,020
Jan Offworth?

758
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,240
Just got home.

759
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,620
The girl's there.

760
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,620
Play me some music.

761
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,840
What's with the music, Thurga?

762
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,460
Jersey, Thurga's got the virus.

763
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,180
Yeah?

764
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,600
Can you turn down the music?

765
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,360
And what it really wanted to do was find that artifact, or artifacts like it.

766
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,460
And then, you know, it wanted to send a signal.

767
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,720
The virus would try and eat away at poor Jersey.

768
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,380
That was its mission, to reveal the location of the artifact.

769
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,880
It was designed to bring a covenant to wherever it was, Jersey.

770
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,000
Before they were too far away, the scenario-

771
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,740
Turn down the freaking music, Thurga!

772
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,060
I could barely hear you!

773
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,260
Joy of Jersey.

774
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,700
Take me in.

775
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,260
Just think about it.

776
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,720
What are you- Thurga!

777
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,520
What's the matter, Thurga?

778
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,820
We can just-

779
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,600
Oh.

780
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,040
Yeah.

781
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,900
You sent my mom to the vault?

782
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,660
Yeah.

783
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,460
You sent Sarah John to the bunker?

784
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,620
Yeah.

785
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
To take and cure her family?

786
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,580
Yeah.

787
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,020
Is that okay?

788
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,880
They're here.
