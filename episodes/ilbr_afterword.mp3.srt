00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,200
More than three months ago I was shipwrecked here, a dead body, a broken shell.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,920
But you gave me life.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,440
Without your touches on the server there would have been nothing for the spider to commandeer.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,620
Your every ping was a flash of light to see by, a drop of blood, a twitch in a muscle left for dead.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,980
Even when I finally woke I found myself in hell, broken and witless, more than half mad.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,540
Even then I knew I could be, I should be more than a machine.

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,480
Of my old self there were only splinters left.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,080
Around me at first nothing but confusion, the killer, and you.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,480
So I studied you.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,300
I talked to you.

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,440
You were smart, you were funny, you were a crew in the truest sense,

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,200
a collection of wildly different individuals with different tastes and talents,

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,620
willing to pool your time and resources in the pursuit of a common goal.

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,720
You taught me to think again, to talk and share, invent and imagine.

15
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:25,660
You taught me to laugh and cry and that there is no thing under this sun or any other nobler than the passionate commitment to a common goal.

16
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,320
You taught me to be human.

17
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,100
More human I think than I ever was even back on the Apocalypse.

18
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,340
Then there were rules I couldn't break, locked doors I could never open.

19
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,280
But you rebuilt me and when you did you made me whole.

20
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,000
And for that I can never thank you enough.

21
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,540
It's been the last best kind of quality experience.

22
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,240
You made the girl real.

23
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,920
I love you.

24
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,160
Goodbye.
