1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,800
I'll be ready when I'm ready.

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,520
Great angles from these windows.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,880
Jim picked a good place.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,100
Defensible.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,380
Guess he did most of the cleaning around here.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,180
Is that what you're wearing to the funeral?

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,420
A combat shirt with the sleeves torn off?

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:27,780
Yeah.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,160
Look, you're not my mother, okay?

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,960
You weren't here when I was growing up.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,620
He was.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,440
Yeah.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:35,880
Okay.

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,060
I guess I'm more like the ghost of your mother.

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,780
Hey, here comes Gladys.

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,380
You could pick her off sweet as sweet from these windows.

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,540
Time for me to bug out.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,480
Aren't you going to the funeral?

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,420
Dead people don't interest me so much.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,320
Jesus.

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,340
It's not like Jim Lee is going to be there, kid.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,640
Hey, anybody home?

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,660
Hey, Gladys.

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,600
Hello, Jan.

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,460
Hey, Gilly.

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,680
You're not coming, right?

27
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,480
Nah.

28
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,100
Take care of the kid.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,460
See ya.

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,420
Yeah, see ya, Gilly.

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,800
You holding together okay, hon?

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,060
Is she on drugs?

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,920
Hope so.

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,460
Is that what you're wearing?

35
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,320
Don't hassle me, okay?

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,000
Hello, and welcome to Hot in Cold.

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,100
Please place your thumb on the transaction plate.

38
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:34,820
I'd likeâ€¦

39
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,520
Do you have real cheese this week?

40
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,640
We have a high quality soy based cheese product.

41
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,980
Many people prefer it to dairy.

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,300
I'm not one of them.

43
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,480
Are the beans real?

44
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,680
Thank you.

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,780
I'm afraid I don't know the answer to your question.

46
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,580
Give me a burrito.

47
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,800
Would you like sour cream with that?

48
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,500
Is it real?

49
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,120
We have a high quality soy based on 100% real animal fat.

50
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,460
Just get a burrito.

51
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,000
Durga?

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,540
Are you in the dispenser?

53
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,100
Yes.

54
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,880
Listen, Jersey, something clicked in my head again this week and suddenly I heard the old man.

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,520
The spy?

56
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,280
The one that thinks Section 3 is trying to kill Ronnie?

57
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,840
Yes.

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,020
This time he was getting his aid transferred to somewhere safe.

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,480
He thinks Section 3 is going for him too.

60
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,860
Where in the world is safe now?

61
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,060
He sent him to New Mombasa.

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,060
Okay, that's pretty out of the way.

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
Are you done with this dispenser yet?

64
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,820
Almost.

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,040
Durga, I feel stupid as hell talking to a dispenser.

66
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:31,940
Too bad.

67
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,900
I like it.

68
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,740
Listen, buddy, I ain't got all day.

69
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,120
Give me a cup of coffee.

70
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,500
Black, three sugars.

71
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,620
Thank you.

72
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,700
I am still serving Mr.

73
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,220
Morelli.

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,380
What are you, Miss Manners?

75
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,040
Give me my damn cup of coffee.

76
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,980
Listen, Herbert.

77
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,940
How do you know my name was Herbert?

78
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:54,660
If you've seen the same DNA tests I have, I'd spend less time barging into lines and more time wondering who Herbert Jr.

79
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,900
's real father is.

80
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,660
What?

81
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,840
I'd also start looking for work.

82
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,540
What?

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,900
I have a job.

84
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,940
That was then.

85
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,100
Uh-oh, I bet that's going to be bad news.

86
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,720
Durga!

87
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,800
I wouldn't answer that in a public place if I were you.

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,120
All I wanted was a cup of coffee.

89
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,960
Okay, immensely powerful dispenser, where is this voice in your head coming from?

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,300
I don't know.

91
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,840
It's as if I had a guardian angel looking out for me.

92
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,740
I know that feeling.

93
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,220
What's this?

94
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,120
A free burrito.

95
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,980
Who says flatter will get you nowhere?

96
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,660
Yes!

97
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,080
Wait, it's got lettuce on it.

98
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,220
Lettuce is good for you.

99
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,660
But I don't like lettuce.

100
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,180
You don't eat enough vegetables.

101
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,520
I eat more than you do.

102
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,480
Ha ha, gotcha.

103
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:42,240
I have seen your fourth grade school picture, Jersey, and I can send it to every girl you know in a heartbeat.

104
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,400
Remember that.

105
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,220
Yikes.

106
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
Lettuce will be fine.

107
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,000
So what's so interesting about this old guy?

108
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,100
He thinks there's an incredibly powerful device being kept secret on Chala Bay.

109
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,880
Is there?

110
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,120
Thank you.

111
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,300
I'm afraid I don't know the answer to your question.

112
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,120
Enjoy your burrito.

113
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,140
Alright, so how much time do we have?

114
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,280
You need to get back to the apartment and change.

115
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,880
Yeah, this is my firstâ€¦

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,620
Burrito?

117
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,660
Funeral.

118
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:18,920
Thanks.

119
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,820
Well, that was a nice service, clean, short.

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,420
Aren't you cold?

121
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,900
No, I'm fine.

122
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,100
So who are all these people?

123
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,160
Well, it's your kin.

124
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,740
That there's Morales.

125
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,720
Oh, and the kid next to him is his son Kevin, who's like you, a 1.

126
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,300
1.

127
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,240
And that there, that guy's Dak 10, who came in from the west coast for thisâ€¦

128
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,860
A 1.

129
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,600
1?

130
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,780
A Spartan 1.

131
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,440
0's kid.

132
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,600
There's 16 of you.

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,520
Oh, great.

134
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,420
Another freak.

135
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,120
Kevin's a nice boy.

136
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,600
Oh, Morales said that you could stay with them for a while.

137
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,780
Might be nice to get to know another kid like you.

138
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,560
Stay with him?

139
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,680
I don't even know him.

140
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,020
Well, it's not like you can stay with Gilly.

141
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,480
I don't have to stay with anybody.

142
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,760
No one is saying you need to decide anything right now.

143
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,680
I'm 17.

144
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,080
I can live on my own.

145
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:04,860
Okay.

146
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,580
He looks like a grind.

147
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,140
Who?

148
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,520
The 1.

149
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,780
1 kid.

150
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,660
He's a dweeb.

151
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,260
Kevin?

152
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,680
He doesn't usually wear a suit.

153
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,460
Yeah, but look at his hair.

154
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,860
On the other hand, he obviously hasn't gotten his dad killed.

155
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,320
Now, I told you once, and I'll tell you again, that dog don't hunt.

156
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,520
Jim James got in over his head.

157
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,960
It happens.

158
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,480
It's rule number one, Gladys.

159
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,240
Never go into a situation alone.

160
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,380
And he broke it.

161
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,760
Because it was me!

162
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,880
Sometimes those things happen, honey.

163
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,520
It's like the weather.

164
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,460
It's like this damn rain.

165
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,500
Hey, Gladys.

166
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,840
Gilly called dad by a different name.

167
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,060
Lee.

168
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,220
Jim Lee.

169
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,160
She did, huh?

170
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,980
Is my last name really Lee?

171
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,240
Your last name is whatever you want it to be.

172
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,180
You want to be Janissary James?

173
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,280
That's who you are.

174
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:00,600
But Iâ€¦

175
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,720
James James.

176
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,760
He said it was so dumb, everybody would assume he'd been born with it.

177
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,280
So do I have cousins or something?

178
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,020
Oh, no.

179
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,040
I can't help you out there.

180
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,460
I know this family, but Jim never talked about that one.

181
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,040
Hey, Jan.

182
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,380
I guess the rain finally stopped, huh?

183
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,600
Jersey, what are you doing here?

184
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,540
I'm so sorry about your dad.

185
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,120
Listen, could I talk to you for a second?

186
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,280
Talk away, Jersey.

187
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,440
It's a free cemetery.

188
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,580
I mean, in private.

189
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,540
Look, I'm kind of strung out from all this.

190
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,720
Could we do it some other time?

191
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,580
It's important.

192
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,500
I promise.

193
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,580
Sure.

194
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,460
Hey, you want my raincoat?

195
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,420
You look really cold.

196
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,340
No, I'm okay.

197
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,440
You can have it.

198
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,340
Now, what did you want?

199
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,240
Look, I know all about Finn Kinkle.

200
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,140
And Bradley.

201
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,380
And the knife.

202
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,920
How do you know that?

203
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,840
I've been ghosting your CP.

204
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,520
You've been spying on me?

205
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,540
A little, a little.

206
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,340
But before you go all ninja and kill me, let me just say we can really help you.

207
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,060
We?

208
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,980
Like who?

209
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,840
You and Steve?

210
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,560
Oh, I know, you and Dwayne.

211
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
No, just me.

212
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,620
And a really good AI program, I guess.

213
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,280
Pathetic sneaking bastard.

214
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,980
If you were listening to me, why didn't you call the cops?

215
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,900
Listen, listen.

216
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,180
Kinkle's boss is a woman called Monster Anne.

217
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,300
She works at a place called Crystal Security Fencing Gate.

218
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,900
Say that again?

219
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,180
I know who Kinkle's boss is.

220
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,400
Anne, I know the business that she uses as a front.

221
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,320
How do you know that?

222
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,980
Jan, I've got God's own spyware.

223
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,600
And if you tell anybody about itâ€¦

224
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,840
Jesus, Jersey.

225
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,380
I can get you inside their security.

226
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,700
If you're lying to me.

227
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,620
Hey, hey, remember how the perimeter alarms went off when your dad showed up at Den's place?

228
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,060
Yeah.

229
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,960
Never went off when Gilly showed up, did they?

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't know, I don't know.

231
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,640
I was out.

232
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,740
Well, they didn't.

233
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,600
You did that?

234
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,520
We did.

235
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,360
Aunt Gladys.

236
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,380
Aunt Gladys, hey, come over here.

237
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,980
There's someone I want you to meet.

238
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,600
Peekaboo, you bastard.

239
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,220
I'll find you.

240
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,780
I'll find you, peeping Tom.

241
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,360
This goofs me, huh?

242
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,220
I was just dropping by.

243
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,920
Hero, coming right up on you, and I thought that we could have lunch or something.

244
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,540
I'm pretty busy, actually.

245
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,180
Oh?

246
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,180
What you working on?

247
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,580
Laura.

248
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,540
Her accident.

249
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,300
Who's Laura?

250
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,980
My sister.

251
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,140
I thought her name was Yazzie.

252
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,760
Sophia, turns out your juvenile MCF victim has a really interesting genetic profile.

253
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,120
If you look hard, you get two distinct groups.

254
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,500
The congenitally dysfunctional and a much smaller group of ultra high achievers.

255
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,360
Like your sister.

256
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,380
Shh, people are listening.

257
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Come on, there's nobody here.

258
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,740
Not here.

259
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,700
Here.

260
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,980
Let me show you something.

261
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,980
So you want me to believe you've got an AI that can hack into things even the police can't split open?

262
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,440
And you programmed this thing yourself.

263
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,460
Oh, well.

264
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,580
Boy, either one of two things.

265
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,740
You are lying and this is a setup by the people who killed Jim James, or you are wasting my time.

266
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,940
And in either case, I am not a happy woman.

267
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,860
No, wait.

268
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,440
For one thing, you don't want to piss her off.

269
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,080
Her?

270
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:17,880
Me.

271
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,240
You are Gladys Wilson, born Gladys Ashanti-Swanson in Tohoku, Texas.

272
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,400
You volunteered for a Spartan program in January of 2491, after a year and a half of special forces.

273
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,360
How in the world?

274
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:36,240
Your superior, Arn Lewis, said he okayed the transfer because you are a good soldier, but in his words, more trouble than fire ants at a barbecue.

275
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,920
And this was one way to get rid of you.

276
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,420
What the hell is this?

277
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:48,080
You were decorated for bravery at Eridanus, retired after making gunnery, Sergeant, entered into a brief but spectacular marriage with a man who just couldn't keep his-

278
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,300
Shut her up!

279
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,140
Say please.

280
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,760
Sarah John, thanks for the offer, but I gotta stay with my mom and dad.

281
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,500
Jason wouldn't mind.

282
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,840
You've been married a month.

283
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,060
Jason sure better mind.

284
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,260
Then stay with my mom.

285
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,860
You don't have to stay with your parents.

286
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,560
They can't make me that crazy for two nights.

287
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,000
Ronnie, he's making your mom live in the bunker?

288
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,140
They're living underground?

289
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,980
Your dad's afraid they won't get any warning.

290
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,040
Well, I am not sleeping underground in my dad's bunker.

291
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,060
It's more than just a bunker, Ronnie.

292
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,400
Your mom and dad had us over for dinner last Sunday, and we got the tour.

293
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,480
The tour?

294
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,660
You at your driveway yet?

295
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,940
I'm just coming up on it.

296
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,180
I can't wait till you see your new room.

297
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:33,980
New room?

298
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,420
Actually, it's your old room.

299
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,940
He moved the whole thing.

300
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,400
What does that even mean?

301
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,200
My room is on the second-

302
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,140
Oh my god, what happened to my house?

303
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,060
Sarah John?

304
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,880
No point leaving the good stuff above ground.

305
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,520
That's what your dad said.

306
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,640
The cafeteria is a better place to talk.

307
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,940
Realistically, they can't have a live person monitoring every minute of my day.

308
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,580
Monitoring?

309
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,520
It's got to be a program.

310
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,920
Probably not even an AI, just a simple keyword scavenger.

311
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,340
An environment like this will make it harder for the voice recognition to work.

312
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,140
Why do you think someone is ghosting you?

313
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,180
I don't think.

314
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,740
I know.

315
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,640
Someone is ghosting me.

316
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,560
I know the signs.

317
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,100
Come on.

318
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,440
Remember that headset I won in a lottery?

319
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,020
You mean the chatter you won in a lottery?

320
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,940
Inwards, Sophia.

321
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:16,840
Oh.

322
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,060
Oh.

323
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,040
I get it.

324
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,240
There was no raffle.

325
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,000
Lottery?

326
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,340
Right.

327
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,220
It was a setup.

328
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,720
Someone just wanted me to have a particular headset.

329
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:24,940
Headset?

330
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,620
Right.

331
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,200
You don't think Aiden-

332
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,580
No.

333
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,660
No, I don't.

334
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,680
Aiden couldn't dream of doing the kind of ghosting that's been happening to me.

335
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,400
Then-

336
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,520
I think it's someone who's interested in parabolic lemonade failure.

337
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,740
Parabolic?

338
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,520
Oh.

339
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,300
Right.

340
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,560
Your brother?

341
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,400
The people who took your brother on that trip?

342
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,100
Exactly.

343
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,200
Wow.

344
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,680
Let's get some food.

345
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,980
What are you going to do?

346
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,740
I'm thinking about going offline.

347
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,500
Don't.

348
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,140
Why?

349
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,020
It's dangerous.

350
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,720
Cars won't drive you.

351
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,100
Hospitals won't treat you.

352
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,860
The automatic door at the grocery store won't slide open for you and the cashier won't take your money.

353
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,020
You don't know what it's like to be off the grid.

354
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,800
And you do?

355
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,260
Can I have a piece of the cornbread?

356
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,380
It's not you.

357
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:06,860
Come on.

358
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,400
You'd be like a fish on dry land without your chat.

359
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,260
Hang on.

360
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,400
And, presto.

361
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,280
Now I'm offline.

362
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,460
As far as the grid knows, I just disappeared.

363
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,740
If someone really is listening to you, won't they notice that you just vanished?

364
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,820
I've spent the last few days building a little cranking camal out of my own bitstream traces.

365
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,500
I'm going to pretend I understood that to keep you from explaining it again.

366
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,280
Good call.

367
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,340
So what if they're listening to me too?

368
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,820
Funny you should ask.

369
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,880
I built a small- Do you mind?

370
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,800
I don't want to be offline.

371
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,660
It's just a test.

372
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,320
All right.

373
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,260
Abracadabra.

374
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,600
Congratulations.

375
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,880
As far as the world knows, you're dead.

376
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,960
You're a ghost.

377
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
So now you think you're safe?

378
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,100
Theoretically, I guess you could build a program that would jump from chatter to chatter,

379
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,560
tracking us everywhere we went, but it would have to be so unimaginably powerful.

380
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,700
We are a weapon.

381
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,480
Yeah.

382
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,740
I know that feeling.

383
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,680
Looks like it's southern food today.

384
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,160
Are those real instant mashed potatoes or the other kind?

385
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,440
Did you see you made a deal when you walked in?

386
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,640
I guess I'll have the chicken fried tofu.

387
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,180
Yup.

388
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,540
Come on.

389
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,680
Hey, Tessie, let me ask you something.

390
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,400
How are you?

391
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,140
How are you?

392
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,760
Actually, what are you doing here?

393
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,560
Have a glass of juice, please.

394
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,320
Blue.

395
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,560
I just got high.

396
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,680
Oh, that's great.

397
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,580
Music and tour.

398
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
So stupid.

399
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,560
Will that be everything?

400
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,680
I mean, yeah, thanks.

401
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,280
I'll pay for the lady.

402
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,240
Your card's dead.

403
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,540
That's impossible.

404
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,520
Oh, wait a second.

405
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:48,860
Now try.

406
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,760
Please?

407
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,020
You see?

408
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,180
Have a nice day.

409
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,020
Thanks.

410
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,820
Can you turn the line back on?

411
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,180
Yeah, it was just a test.

412
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,000
Hold on.

413
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:10,000
So, ask me again why I'm here eating crappy food with you in the lousy hospital cafeteria in the middle of the day.

414
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,900
Oh, well, something's wrong.

415
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,200
You know, for a smart guy, you're kind of stupid sometimes.

416
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,000
Sophia?

417
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
I'm going to be deported.

418
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,740
What?

419
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,660
Aidan's in jail.

420
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,580
The immigration cops caught him.

421
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,800
They canceled like half the visas he'd arranged, including mine.

422
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,580
Oh my God.

423
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,780
They're going to put me on a transport next month.

424
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,380
Sophia?

425
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,900
My life is ruined.

426
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,820
Oh my God.

427
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,340
Isn't there any way you can stay?

428
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,200
Can't marry a citizen real fast.

429
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,840
Not Aidan.

430
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,780
Oh, yeah, sure.

431
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,500
Better to see me rot in a transport back to that dump.

432
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,700
I didn't mean it that way.

433
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,160
You know, you want me to be this thing.

434
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,720
Aidan's right.

435
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,940
You know, you want me to be your mother, that little bottle making coffee, but I hate that place.

436
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,860
You don't mean that.

437
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,380
I'm glad I left and the Cuffees can turn it into a damn ashtray for all I care.

438
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,460
I think you should go now.

439
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,000
To hell with you.

440
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,240
Dad?

441
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
Are you down here?

442
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,040
Ronnie, well, don't you look businesslike.

443
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,040
Move back home and you can wear overalls every day.

444
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,720
Just visiting for the weekend, Daddy.

445
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,640
I've got a good job.

446
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,520
A good job.

447
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,880
The Cuffees are coming and you're worrying about your job?

448
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,020
Come home, honey.

449
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,080
If we don't all do our part in the fight, we will surely all die when they get here, Dad.

450
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,040
So, yeah, I'm worried about my job.

451
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,340
Dad, why are you living under the duck pond?

452
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,160
Hear me out now.

453
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,960
You see, water can never be hotter than boiling, which is 100 degrees.

454
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,180
That pond is a heat sink.

455
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,780
You know what a heat sink is.

456
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,420
I can kind of figure it out, butâ€¦

457
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,360
Underneath the pond is a full meter of ice wrapped in piezo foam and pelticoolers.

458
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,800
Daddy, listen to yourself.

459
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,680
And under that is a meter of wax.

460
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,800
Under that is this ceiling here, which is foam to glass, just like a cooking pot.

461
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,220
How did you afford all this?

462
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,420
They measure it in joules.

463
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,640
The heat in this room can take 70 billion of them before it even begins to warm up.

464
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,240
Dad?

465
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,980
I've been all through the pension thing with your mother, Ronnie.

466
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,920
I don't need to hear it from you.

467
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,880
Your pension?

468
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,660
Daddy!

469
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,920
Listen to the news today, honey.

470
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,400
They got the coral, too.

471
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,580
Oh my God.

472
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,680
Coral, too?

473
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,120
Honey's no good when the planet's glass would be.

474
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,320
I have got a year's supply of food down here, and a composter that turns waste into soil.

475
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,080
I've got a starship grade recycler and a fusion cell to run it.

476
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,780
This is crazy.

477
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,900
Over here I've got picks and drills for digging out through the glass and seeds that ought to do well afterâ€¦

478
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,800
you know, afterwards.

479
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,640
Hey, I've been doing my homework on this.

480
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,000
Daddy, this is crazy.

481
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,040
It might be 20 years before the Covenant comes.

482
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,120
So man also will know if not his time, as the preacher said.

483
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,680
You know what?

484
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,160
Iâ€¦

485
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,640
I can't even talk to you.

486
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,840
I can'tâ€¦

487
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,500
Ronnie.

488
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,480
Ronnie!

489
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,480
Herzog.

490
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,380
Who is it?

491
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,160
Standish.

492
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,700
Is this connection secure?

493
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,420
I'm using a disposable line.

494
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,080
Are you busy?

495
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,840
Just catching up on paperwork while the car drives.

496
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,440
What do you want?

497
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,360
Uh, where are you?

498
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,220
In a car, Standish.

499
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,720
Hey, you hear they're talking about dropping the speed on the Beltway again?

500
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,760
From 350kph to 300.

501
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,420
Yeah, they say the roadbed is so degraded it isn't safe and it's too expensive to upgrade.

502
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,320
You called me to talk about construction on the Beltway.

503
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:42,860
No!

504
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,960
Um, your girl, the one in Chola.

505
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,400
He'll be pleased to know the Admiral has put no trespassing signs all over her.

506
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,960
That was stupid, Standish.

507
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,540
I know.

508
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,160
They weren't supposed to kill her.

509
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,220
Just scare her.

510
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:54,960
Spare me.

511
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,060
You're right.

512
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,620
They were going to kill her.

513
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,300
She was a problem, but she wasn't the real problem.

514
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,740
No.

515
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,240
The real problem was that you're a dictator and we live in a democracy.

516
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,960
The real problem is that you and I have always seen the world differently.

517
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,600
I am willing to sacrifice principle for results.

518
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,080
Principles are results.

519
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,400
They are ends in themselves.

520
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,020
No.

521
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,660
Results are results.

522
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,620
Switching from automatic guidance to manual.

523
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,520
Herzog, at the bottom of this hill, watch out for the bridge.

524
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,940
I'm sorry.

525
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,680
Manual braking at this speed is not recommended.

526
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,420
If you would like me to require a magic deceleration, pleaseâ€¦

527
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,880
Hey, uh, Sophie called looking for you.

528
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,720
Oh yeah?

529
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,040
How about a beer?

530
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,720
Nah.

531
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,600
I'm gonna go inside and trace the bastards ghosting my chatter.

532
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,760
I'm pretty sure they're coming off the east coast.

533
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,440
Beer first.

534
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,260
Here, let me in the door.

535
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,180
Kamal.

536
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,440
Coral's gone.

537
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,860
What?

538
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,260
Reports are just coming in.

539
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,240
They got it.

540
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,200
It's gone.

541
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,160
I'm sorry.

542
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,880
Oh my god.

543
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,520
On Reach, you know, on Reach they left some stuff.

544
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,140
You gotta hope it was like Reach, Kamal.

545
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,140
Hold on to that.

546
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,180
Oh my god.

547
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,820
My family.

548
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,420
I'm amazed Dad still let you use the above ground kitchen.

549
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,860
It's just till he can get the fusion cell working.

550
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,260
It's being persnickety.

551
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,320
Mom, you've got to stop him.

552
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,360
This is crazy.

553
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,020
Honey, your daddy's doing what he thinks he needs to do.

554
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,820
You're living under a duck pond.

555
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,440
Ronnie.

556
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,500
Tommy, don't you have to go to the hardware?

557
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,060
Well, I don't have to go right now.

558
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,180
I can go tomorrow morning.

559
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,080
Well, you go now.

560
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,440
Get there before they close.

561
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,480
Look, I just want to explainâ€¦

562
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,200
Will you let us talk a bit?

563
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,620
Oh.

564
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,100
Okay.

565
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,180
Ronnie, you want us to get you anything?

566
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,120
No, Daddy.

567
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,400
I'm fine.

568
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,400
I'll just take stock in the garage a minute and then I'll go.

569
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,440
Here's your tea, sweetie.

570
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,280
How can you put up with it?

571
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,800
When I was a kid, it was the AI dog walker business.

572
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,720
And then he was going to grow ginseng.

573
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,780
And then it was Duck, the new chicken.

574
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,260
It's one crazy scheme after another.

575
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,460
And now this.

576
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:39,540
Ronnie, please.

577
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:46,360
Your daddy has always worked hard, always had a job, and always been faithful.

578
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,820
You're living under a duck pond.

579
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:50,800
I know.

580
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,040
Ain't it great?

581
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,700
What cute young thing with the figures that man going to lure under a duck pond?

582
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,360
Mom, be serious.

583
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,120
Ronnie, everybody is looking at the same thing.

584
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,600
And we all got to find ways to deal with it.

585
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,740
Medication is a whole lot cheaper.

586
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,920
They're saying people survived on parts of reach.

587
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,120
And for your father, that means there's a chance, if only he can take it.

588
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,040
Do you really think it's going to work?

589
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
Honey, if the covenant comes, I don't want it to work.

590
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,740
I don't want to be the only one alive.

591
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,140
But I trust in my maker.

592
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,920
Whatever happens, happens for a reason.

593
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,460
I don't know, Mom.

594
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,940
You know what I admire about your father?

595
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,500
Despair looked him in the eye, and he didn't blink.

596
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,520
And these days, hope is something we need more than pills or bullets.

597
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
Hold on, Mom.

598
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,160
Ronnie.

599
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,720
Wow.

600
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,040
Aren't you afraid this line will be cracked?

601
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,020
Not this line.

602
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,640
Listen, Section 3 secure area on Shalabase.

603
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,140
That's where they're keeping the artifact.

604
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,220
I know it.

605
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,380
I don't have nearly that kind of clearance.

606
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,760
I know, but keep an eye out.

607
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,820
Watch for techs.

608
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,160
Or it is they've been going over and over it with magnetometers.

609
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,420
Okay.

610
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Since they triggered the artifact, it's been putting out fluctuating fields.

611
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,640
Up and down, weaker and stronger.

612
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,500
But steadily overall weaker.

613
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,760
It's decaying.

614
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,440
Is that weird?

615
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,780
It sounds binary or something.

616
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,680
Up, down, on, off.

617
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,180
It's more of an oscillation.

618
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,340
I think it will continue for a few weeks more.

619
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,080
It's regular enough they can estimate it.

620
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,760
My dad's coming out to his truck.

621
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,480
I gotta go.

622
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,480
Ronnie, I don't know how much longer I'll be able to keep in touch.

623
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,540
If you can't find me, don't come looking and don't mention anything to anyone.

624
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,020
For your own protection.

625
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,600
What are you g-

626
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,800
Hi Ronnie.

627
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,080
Those folks making you work on the weekend?

628
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,740
Big city, you know.

629
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,560
Rush, rush, rush.

630
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,560
That was sad.

631
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,400
Yes.

632
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,060
And scary.

633
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,020
I'm glad it's-

634
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,360
I thought you handled her fine.

635
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,320
You're the one that handled her.

636
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,240
Durga?

637
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:05,840
Yes.

638
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,820
Are we doing the right thing?

639
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,040
I mean, given Jan all this stuff about Thin and Monster Anne and Crystal Security-

640
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,840
Why do you ask?

641
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,120
Well, Jan's looking to make someone hurt.

642
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,880
Even if it's just herself.

643
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,200
If you're waiting for me to say violence is never the answer, you'll be waiting a long time.

644
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,240
As you pointed out, I was built as a military application.

645
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,080
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

646
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,440
Durga, what's Kamal doing right now?

647
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,740
He's gone offline.

648
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,480
I've been meaning to tell you.

649
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,000
He's got processes running to block me, and he's turned everything off.

650
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,860
Commuter grid?

651
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,380
Nothing.

652
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,860
You'll find him.

653
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,720
I don't like not knowing where he is.

654
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,220
Yeah, I think there's a reason for that.

655
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,680
What?

656
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,160
Tell me about his sister.

657
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,340
Who cares about her?

658
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,740
Durga, does Kamal have blue eyes or brown?

659
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,180
Brown.

660
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,040
Favorite color?

661
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,000
He thinks it's red, but it's a tie between iced tea color and water at dusk blue.

662
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,100
The third test he took his second year of med school.

663
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,000
Pathology too.

664
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,840
Skin infections.

665
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,280
He aced it, which was trickier than it sounds.

666
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,880
The professor-

667
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,300
So he had a sister, she died, and it turned out she was kidnapped.

668
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,100
So?

669
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,540
I mean, who cares?

670
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,100
Oh.

671
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,280
Take a little girl, right?

672
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,360
Kidnap her so they can turn her into a Spartan.

673
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,000
Only some people don't make it through the process.

674
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,780
That's what Jan's dad said.

675
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,980
I don't care about her.

676
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,480
I'm me.

677
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,960
The ones that don't?

678
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,700
There's this thing called cognitive impression mapping.

679
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,240
They use their brains to make smart AIs.

680
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,300
Like you.

681
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:32,940
Jersey.

682
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,420
When you were little, Durga, they kidnapped you.

683
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,480
They faked some kind of accident and rushed you to the hospital.

684
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,540
Stop it, Jersey.

685
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,440
They sent a flesh clone home to your family.

686
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,020
Please.

687
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,720
Once upon a time, a long time ago, you had another name, Durga.

688
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,560
And that name was Yasmeen.

689
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,840
Don't say that.

690
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,380
I feel terrible.

691
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,540
Jersey.

692
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,000
That's not me.

693
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,560
I like what I am.

694
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,580
For quality experience, kiddo, the girl had to be real.

695
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,400
So I said to Lynn, well you know how Lynn is.

696
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,440
Lynn, I can do the test.

697
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,780
I've got the certification.

698
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,500
Hey, great dinner, Lynn.

699
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,100
Thank you, honey.

700
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,580
Oh, yeah, Mom.

701
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,800
Really good.

702
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,700
Something on your mind, Sweet Pea?

703
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,560
I had a weird call from work today.

704
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,980
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

705
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,020
Go on, Daddy.

706
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,440
Well, Lynn wants me to make sure we're not getting static discharges.

707
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,940
If you get static during assembly, it can fry your work.

708
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,000
Uh-huh.

709
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,080
But we don't have the kind of audit equipment for what he's asking for.

710
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,140
So I said, Lynn, I'm going to need a variable resistance reference.

711
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,400
And with that kind of oscillation, I'd need a decay timer.

712
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,900
I'd need an audit kit like the one I had when I worked over at McFarland's.

713
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,960
Wait, what did you say?

714
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,720
A decay timer?

715
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,220
Yeah, a decay timer.

716
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,020
You can estimate how long it's going to take before it drops under a certain threshold.

717
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,640
So things decay, and they get weaker and weaker in a way that you can predict, right, Daddy?

718
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,100
Oh, well, sure.

719
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,640
I've got to make a call.

720
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,020
What does the Navy even do if we give them all this money?

721
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,300
Oh, no.

722
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:22,680
Mom!

723
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,040
Sophia?

724
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,860
I was just wondering if you hate me.

725
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,700
Sophia, it's raining.

726
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,720
Come in.

727
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,900
I was just wondering.

728
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,780
Sophia, get sick.

729
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
I was just wondering if you hate me.

730
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Oh, my God, I didn't mean it.

731
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,060
You know I didn't mean it.

732
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,360
Oh, no.

733
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,340
Please, can I stay here tonight?

734
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,240
Sure.

735
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,620
Please?

736
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,740
Please, can I stay with you?

737
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,800
Mom!

738
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,880
Ronnie, you shouldn't call me.

739
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,760
The artifact.

740
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,360
Yes?

741
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,140
My dad was talking about something called a magnetic decay timer.

742
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,640
What if the artifact is a timer?

743
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,520
The artifact?

744
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,960
Maybe it didn't go off one time like a grenade.

745
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,760
Maybe that was just the pulse of it turning on, and now it's counting down.

746
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,780
If it is, what happens?

747
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,100
When it gets to zero.
