1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,360
Now Justino, you watch that wrist and do what the doctor told you.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,740
And stay off the roof.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,100
Okay, that's the last of them.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,780
I can have you in Pittsburgh in an hour.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,500
Thanks.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,380
For what?

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,100
Four hours of doctoring?

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,060
It's literally the least I could do.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,680
What's wrong?

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,680
I'm worried about your cousin, Jessie.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,280
She's too young for disc troubles.

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,600
You should make her go to a clinic.

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,460
What are you thinking?

14
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm not thinking anything, but I want to rule out a spinal tumor.

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,000
So, where'd you learn all this stuff?

16
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,320
I worked in a hospital.

17
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,640
My friend Brad says he thinks you're on the lam.

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,420
Brad thinks you're a doctor and maybe you killed a bunch of people in a hospital.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,880
But I don't think so.

20
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,420
I don't think you would kill anyone.

21
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,500
I haven't yet, but if I keep treating people without proper training or tools I probably will.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,980
So who's Brad?

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,420
He's my…

24
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,420
a friend.

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,020
He a colonial?

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,480
No, he's from Earth.

27
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,260
You know, when I was living on Marmor I thought that Earth was really cool, but it's a dump.

28
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,800
Well, what do you expect from a place called dirt?

29
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:07,800
Huh?

30
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,560
You know, Earth, like soil, dirt.

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,260
Didn't you ever make fun of it when you were a kid?

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,040
No.

33
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,360
So are you on the lam?

34
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,100
So where'd your people get all these anti-infectives anyway?

35
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,060
Black Market.

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,360
Do you have a girlfriend?

37
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,080
Maybe I killed her.

38
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,660
You know, when I killed all those people in the hospital.

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Don't make fun of me.

40
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
I'm not stupid.

41
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,040
I don't have a girlfriend.

42
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,380
I never really did.

43
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,140
Ooh!

44
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,460
Touchy subjects.

45
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,720
So, what comes next?

46
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,380
I drop you off at Jerry's Diner and this truck driver my dad knows will take you to New Jersey.

47
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,380
Thanks, Isabelle.

48
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,660
You're a good assistant.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,040
So, are you going to tell me why you're on the lam?

50
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,880
I fell in love with the girlfriend of the wrong guy.

51
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,400
That sounds romantic.

52
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,460
Not really.

53
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,060
I think she went back to him.

54
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,020
The slut?

55
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,420
It was probably the right choice.

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,580
God, if I turned down a doctor who wanted to marry me, my mom would strangle me.

57
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,340
I'm not a doctor!

58
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,920
So, why are you going to New Jersey?

59
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,620
Someone there has been watching me.

60
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,320
They know something about my family.

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,180
My family is the last thing I want to know more about.

62
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,520
Yeah, well, I'm from Coral.

63
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,680
Oh, geez, I'm sorry.

64
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,340
It's okay.

65
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,060
Well, it's not okay, but it can't be fixed, so I'm fixing what I can.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,380
I found something out this week.

67
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,260
What's that?

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,680
I want to be a doctor.

69
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,780
You already are.

70
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,940
They reassigned me to recruitment and sent me back here to fly a desk instead.

71
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,520
Do you miss it?

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,600
Sometimes.

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,320
I miss the guys.

74
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,300
But it was time.

75
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,260
It's okay when you carry the war on your back.

76
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,960
It's heavy, but you do it because you…

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,200
You have to.

78
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:51,880
Right.

79
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,060
When you start seeing your whole life through a targeting scope.

80
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,540
Oh, yeah.

81
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,520
You got family in the service?

82
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,720
Father and mother.

83
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,100
They know you're here?

84
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,440
My dad's dead.

85
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,280
Less than a month.

86
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
My mom's a bit of a bug.

87
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,240
They met in Special Forces.

88
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,860
Sorry for your loss.

89
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,800
It's okay.

90
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,180
So, hand on the plate, and we'll start the application.

91
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,020
What?

92
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:15,840
Wait.

93
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,380
You're not 18.

94
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,300
You're 17.

95
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,660
It rounds up to 18.

96
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,480
My birthday's in four months.

97
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
Four and a half.

98
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,660
You didn't think to mention that?

99
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,300
Look, I'm on my own.

100
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,000
What difference does a few months make?

101
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,880
We gotta draw the line somewhere, kid.

102
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,460
People see us inducting children that'll be panicking the streets.

103
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,300
Is that a joke?

104
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,740
Look around you.

105
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,020
Even Reach has fallen.

106
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,240
Sorry, kiddo.

107
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm all for patriotism.

108
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,540
But you're gonna have to wait four months.

109
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,800
Okay, what if my mom signed for me?

110
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,540
Oh, that doesn't make me sound more grown up.

111
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,520
Not so much.

112
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,020
Look!

113
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,400
Look!

114
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:49,920
Hey!

115
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,420
You can't draw that in here!

116
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,420
Just watch.

117
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,640
I can strip clean and reassemble an M6 in one quarter regulation time.

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,580
You're fast.

119
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,860
I can shoot 87% with an SRS at a thousand meters.

120
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,840
You're a liar.

121
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,240
Yeah.

122
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,680
What's your real score?

123
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,920
99.

124
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,320
But?

125
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,140
I thought you wouldn't believe me.

126
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,540
Only 99?

127
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,220
There was a crosswind.

128
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,000
See that eye chart?

129
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,820
Read me the bottom line.

130
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,360
Microprinting supplied by Opticon test instruments.

131
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,100
A limited liability sector of the…

132
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,340
Actually, I meant the bigger line of letters above that.

133
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,060
But never mind.

134
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,440
Sergeant, I know I look like just another teenage girl to you, but believe me, I can be the best soldier you ever recruited.

135
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,800
Made me look good, you think?

136
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,800
I swear it.

137
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,660
You really ready to kick some Covenant butt?

138
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,600
Sergeant, I did not always know this, but I was meant to be a soldier from the day I was born.

139
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,420
Ah!

140
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,140
There's just one problem.

141
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:45,820
What?

142
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,200
You're 17.

143
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,060
But I can do this if you…

144
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,000
I know you can.

145
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,600
That isn't the point.

146
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,280
Of course it's the point.

147
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,960
You're a good kid.

148
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Right now you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders.

149
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,920
And instead of running from that, you want to meet it head on.

150
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,820
I admire that.

151
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,600
But you're 17, Chickadee.

152
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,620
Let someone else save the world for a few months.

153
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,080
I've got no money, no place to go, nothing…

154
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,200
What am I supposed to do?

155
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,340
Find a boyfriend.

156
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,600
Stay up too late, talk on the chatter.

157
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,160
Life is short enough without rushing into combat.

158
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,020
I just want a chance to do something that matters.

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,680
The Cubbies are going to give us all that chance, kid.

160
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,700
Soon enough.

161
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,540
And when they do, no matter how many you fight, no matter how many you kill…

162
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,660
Yeah?

163
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,260
It's not going to bring your father back.

164
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,900
It just won't.

165
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,940
Go home, Janissary James.

166
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,660
Next!

167
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,220
So, I'm thinking of maybe taking a post somewhere else.

168
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,480
Leave in Boston?

169
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,980
Yeah.

170
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,640
And getting a haircut.

171
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,520
What does getting a haircut have to do with leaving Boston?

172
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,920
A whole new me, you know?

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,800
Don't you think I look a bit…

174
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Trumpy?

175
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,840
Not professional?

176
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,520
I think you sound really freaked out.

177
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,400
I think this job is really getting to you.

178
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,020
Yeah, I got mixed up with this guy.

179
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,700
He had me convinced that there was all this weird stuff going on, but he was crazy.

180
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,720
He was crazy?

181
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,260
Yeah.

182
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,600
And I fell for it.

183
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,100
No.

184
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,580
What do you mean, no?

185
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,680
You were the one who told Trisha that Kale was two-timing her.

186
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880
That was different.

187
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,980
Kale was an idiot.

188
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,020
Yeah, but you knew Mr.

189
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,600
McKenzie was having an affair with Ms.

190
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,760
Delvecchio, and that Gupta Singh was lying to us about his mom.

191
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,000
She needed the pension money.

192
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,900
Anyone could see that.

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
Now, if this guy was crazy, you would have known.

194
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,000
But Major Stander said that…

195
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,120
Then whoever this Stander is, he's a liar.

196
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,200
I…

197
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,700
I gotta go.

198
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,380
He was lying to you, Ronnie.

199
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,400
And don't you believe it.

200
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,300
Yes?

201
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,860
Yeah, listen.

202
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,460
You don't know me, but I have to talk to you.

203
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,100
Yes?

204
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,280
It's about the you-know-what at Charla.

205
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,560
You know from the apocalypse.

206
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,920
Look, you can tell Major Standish I didn't bite.

207
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,740
I'm keeping my nose clean.

208
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,620
Standish?

209
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,100
Wait, he's the dinkwit, right?

210
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,040
Although, you are an odd choice for the bait.

211
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,840
I mean, you're what, seventeen?

212
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,660
Eighteen.

213
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,680
Thank you very much.

214
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,040
Since June…

215
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,340
You came out from New York by train to talk to me about…

216
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,980
What's in New York?

217
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,380
You're doing that thing.

218
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,080
That detective thing.

219
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,920
How did you know I came from New York?

220
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,000
My accent?

221
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,660
Oh, the way I dress.

222
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,160
Like that Oni guy who jumped you but he had the wrong shoes.

223
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,040
You've got a security check in your bag and it says NYC in huge black letters.

224
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,440
Oh, right.

225
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,760
If you know about the Oni guy, you're obviously Oni.

226
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,280
And you're clueless.

227
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,260
Goodbye.

228
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,360
Ronnie, Sarah-John is right.

229
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,320
You know Standish is lying to you.

230
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,120
You know he tried to have Herzog killed.

231
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,960
Who are you?

232
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,500
And how did you know that?

233
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,100
I'm a rogue military AI.

234
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,500
I think I came in on the apocalypse, but I don't know because I can't remember.

235
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,840
You're what?

236
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,660
I can't believe you told her that.

237
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,660
Why didn't you just come right out and tell her that?

238
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,940
Because lying to Ronnie is stupid.

239
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,380
And you expect me to believe you?

240
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,040
Ask me a question and if I can find the answer, I'll tell you.

241
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,360
For example, right now, Nick is off duty and playing ping pong with a guy they call Itchy.

242
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,320
Hey, you leave Nick out of this.

243
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,360
What do you want to know?

244
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,240
Did we know Troy was going to be glassed?

245
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,280
Yes.

246
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,100
It's clear we've broken at least some covenant transmission protocols.

247
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,840
So why did Reach fall?

248
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,820
Space is big.

249
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,140
Really big.

250
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,160
We have to be in the right place to hear the right transmission.

251
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,780
Troy was a lucky break.

252
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,380
I'm sorry.

253
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,780
Your chatter hasn't sufficient storage for my evidence, so I've summarized it and forwarded it as much as possible to you.

254
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:57,920
Oh my god.

255
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,660
My memory is full.

256
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,060
What?

257
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,880
These names.

258
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,100
What are these names?

259
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,380
Contact information for every Troy evacuee.

260
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,760
The ones who have died since the evac are marked in red.

261
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,080
What are you?

262
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,340
Derva is a very curious girl.

263
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,360
Ronnie, we both know we have to shut the artifact down.

264
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,260
Look at the information I sent you.

265
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,800
If you are willing to help, come meet with us on Saturday.

266
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,660
Look, I don't.

267
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,420
The artifact is just…

268
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,620
I can't do anything about it.

269
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,120
But Ronnie, you've got to help us.

270
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,800
That thing could be a giant bomb that could brainwash us all so we join the covenant.

271
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,160
I can't.

272
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,460
You don't understand.

273
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,340
They're watching me.

274
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,120
And I just…

275
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,700
can't.

276
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,780
You're going to have to be a little brave, Ronnie.

277
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,860
Think about it.

278
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,740
Saturday.

279
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,480
And if you come, I won't even make you talk through a door.

280
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,760
I'm not sure.

281
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,880
Oh, you mentioned a haircut.

282
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,720
You know of a guy in Beacon Hill, the best in Boston.

283
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,260
It's open!

284
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,020
I'm flying out.

285
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,460
Oh, jeez.

286
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,620
It would be you.

287
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,180
What do you mean, it would be me?

288
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,100
Freaking…

289
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,100
come in.

290
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,740
My name's Jersey.

291
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,200
My name is Kamal Zaman.

292
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,020
I know.

293
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,760
Listen, there's someone you should meet.

294
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,840
You know something about my sister.

295
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,160
Derva!

296
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,580
Who the hell is that?

297
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,200
You have to!

298
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,280
I can't.

299
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,180
It's like the wrong end of a magnet.

300
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,300
I can't.

301
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,920
Kamal, meet Derva.

302
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,080
Derva, meet Kamal.

303
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,260
What the hell's going on here?

304
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,620
What do you know about my sister?

305
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,140
Nothing.

306
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,300
Kamal, Durga is your sister.

307
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,420
I'm not.

308
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,680
I'm not, yes, me.

309
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,260
I'm merely copied from her personality matrix.

310
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,600
Your sister was abducted into the Spartan class of 2037, but she washed out.

311
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,180
Washed out?

312
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,540
What does that mean?

313
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,500
She died, Kamal.

314
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,020
She was too weak, and she died.

315
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,680
Oh my god.

316
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:09,760
They took her, they trained her, they shot her full of hormones and embedded things inside her bones, and finally her body gave up and she died.

317
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,420
No.

318
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,900
There's no point in being sentimental.

319
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,060
She didn't give up.

320
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,800
Maybe they killed her, but she never gave up.

321
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,820
I can still hear your voice in there, Yasmin.

322
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,240
You never gave up in your life.

323
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,100
Wasn't you, Jersey?

324
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,060
Hey, take it easy with that stuff, pal.

325
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,120
Durga is herself.

326
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,020
She's nobody else.

327
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,960
The hell she is.

328
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,320
You know what they say.

329
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,260
You don't get to choose your family.

330
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,900
She's stuck with me.

331
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,000
Kamal, this you and me and Coral Forever stuff didn't work so great on Sophie either, did it?

332
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,060
Ow!

333
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,440
Come on!

334
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,960
Sophie, is that coffee for you?

335
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,960
Stop it, you two.

336
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,180
Sophie, get to your now.

337
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,480
You know you were a real hero now, wouldn't you?

338
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:00,860
This is how you get your jolly, sick, buying on people.

339
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,560
Not like you.

340
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,380
Stop it!

341
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,120
Stop it!

342
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,740
Come on!

343
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,260
Hey, hey!

344
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,080
Stop!

345
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,460
When he started, I was eating.

346
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,820
And he hit me in the head.

347
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,360
At least I don't spy on other people.

348
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,180
Well, he tried to kill me with a lamp.

349
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,320
He punched me in the neck!

350
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,720
He tried to kill me with a lamp.

351
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,880
Excuse me.

352
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,560
Is this seat taken?

353
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,860
No, but there's a lot of empty seats in this car.

354
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,840
Oh, would you rather not?

355
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,840
You prefer blondes?

356
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,280
No, I…

357
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,900
I mean, it's just that…

358
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,020
Well, then.

359
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,420
I figured since you're following me, it would be more convenient if I just sat down right here.

360
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,580
Following you?

361
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,520
Are you crazy?

362
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,640
I already got a girlfriend, lady.

363
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,560
Oh, I know.

364
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,700
Major Standish is just the dreamiest, isn't he?

365
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,340
I don't know what you're talking about.

366
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,160
I caught you twice in store windows on my way down at the station.

367
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,220
Here's a free tip.

368
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:12,220
I'm not much of a window shopper, so usually if you see me peer into glass like that, just assume you've been made.

369
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,780
You can still keep this all, but you're polite.

370
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,140
Just go back and pretend that you don't notice.

371
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,220
I don't worry so much about polite when I'm being stalked.

372
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,720
Look, this is really starting to annoy me.

373
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,720
Will you sit there and tell me bare-faced that this is all for my own protection?

374
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,400
I will stand up and scream brave, so help me God!

375
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,560
Listen, cowgirl, the only way I touch you is with a cattle prod.

376
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,320
And don't think I haven't thought about it.

377
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,160
Tickets, please.

378
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,760
Here's my confirmation.

379
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,960
Got a ticket?

380
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,160
Yeah, here.

381
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,780
Mmm, this ticket was for yesterday.

382
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,540
That's impossible, I just bought it.

383
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,880
Well, oh well.

384
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,940
Someone hasn't paid a lot of parking money.

385
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,420
I can find some.

386
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,440
Whoa!

387
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,080
Conductor assist, I have a passenger here wanted for grand theft auto.

388
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,640
I never stole any cars!

389
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,820
Fraud too.

390
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,840
Selling fake insurance policies.

391
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,280
I don't see.

392
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,140
Oh, you're right!

393
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,120
What are you doing?

394
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,760
To the widows of vets?

395
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,040
Hey, but, but, hold on!

396
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,720
Get on your feet!

397
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,440
Come on, man!

398
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,300
What kind of person would take advantage of the widows of men who have died to save us all?

399
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,160
Some people.

400
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,600
This is all a mistake!

401
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,420
Yeah, funny.

402
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,920
I don't get how they…

403
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,900
It's a butterfly, Cliff.

404
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,420
It just…

405
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:36,900
Ow!

406
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,100
I'm whining.

407
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,680
You know, your bedside manner leaves something to be awkward.

408
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,020
Shut up.

409
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,080
Right back at you, Doc.

410
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,660
How the hell am I going to explain this to my mom?

411
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,760
I'll pay for the damage!

412
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,660
With what?

413
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,480
Poker chips?

414
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,520
Oh, that's great.

415
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,240
I'll send her for a week in Atlantic City.

416
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,400
We can collect a complete set of dishes with dancing girls on them.

417
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,100
Well, there's no point in being offline anymore.

418
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,440
What the hell is with you?

419
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,560
If anyone should be upset…

420
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,260
Look, look, look at this!

421
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,080
Of course.

422
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,760
Look, look, this was her favorite lamp!

423
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,360
You're jealous.

424
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,920
I've got nothing to be jealous about.

425
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Except sharing Durga.

426
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,480
Yeah, with the silver-aged creep who thinks he can work the chatter.

427
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,740
Well, look at it from my perspective.

428
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,540
What?

429
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,380
My sister's spending her time with a sullen punk kid who wouldn't tell the government where one of their top class AIs is going.

430
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,180
Because then he wouldn't have his favorite toy anymore.

431
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,520
I told him not to.

432
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,800
Way to contribute to the war effort, hero.

433
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,900
Leave him alone.

434
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,000
I don't think I will.

435
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,580
A top class AI costs, what, the price of a destroyer?

436
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,420
What if that mind, your mind, Yasmin, could have made a difference at Coral?

437
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,220
That's not fair.

438
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,900
You know, fair is not something I care about so much anymore.

439
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,580
Kamal, we need your help.

440
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,240
We do not need his help.

441
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,520
Jersey, I don't waste assets.

442
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,380
Help doing what?

443
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,600
There is nothing you could do to save your sister.

444
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,000
Nothing more you could have done to save your parents.

445
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,960
Our parents.

446
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,880
But I can give you something more precious than you can possibly imagine.

447
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,920
You, Durga, or you, Yasmin?

448
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,120
All right, both of us.

449
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,400
Most of precious was on Coral for me, Yasmin.

450
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,660
And the rest left me standing at a bus stop outside of Oakland.

451
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,320
What are you going to give me?

452
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,040
Another chance to save me.

453
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,480
Another chance to save the world.

454
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,440
Hey, Jan, I thought you were going to enlist.

455
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,700
So, you said Durga might be able to help me find a job?

456
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,680
What happened?

457
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,140
I'm not 18.

458
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,000
They told me to go get a boyfriend or something.

459
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,240
I'll volunteer.

460
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,540
What a patriot.

461
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,100
No, not for the medium.

462
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,060
I know what you meant, Jersey.

463
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,160
And frankly, don't take this the wrong way.

464
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,960
You're not the hero type.

465
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,280
There's a right way to take that.

466
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,140
She means it would take a hero to be her boyfriend, Jersey.

467
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,880
Ooh, cat fight.

468
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,220
Well, my guys do seem to end up dead.

469
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,500
Jan, it wasn't my fault.

470
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

471
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,180
Listen, can you just change my records so I'm 18?

472
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,800
I could, but I won't.

473
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,620
What?

474
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,360
Are you going to tell me I should go get a boyfriend now and bake cookies too?

475
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,240
You probably should.

476
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,560
What difference is it going to make if the Covenant shows up tomorrow?

477
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,900
If I enlisted, at least I could fight.

478
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,660
If the Covenant showed up tomorrow, you wouldn't even be in basic.

479
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,540
You know what I mean!

480
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,140
Damn it!

481
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,800
What the?

482
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,320
I just bought a new lamp and replaced the dishes.

483
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,480
Would you people please stop tearing up my mom's apartment?

484
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,500
But I have something else you could do.

485
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,600
What, like a job?

486
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,080
Work for me.

487
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,240
I'll cover your rent.

488
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,260
Doing what?

489
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,380
Breaking into Chala Base in Boston.

490
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,560
You're crazier than Gilly.

491
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,240
Possible, but not likely.

492
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,120
I'll keep an eye on it though.

493
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,400
So, there's this artifact on Chala Base being kept under wraps.

494
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,400
The Navy thinks it's some kind of Covenant superweapon, but…

495
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,920
There are reports of it being a trickle-back from a ship called the Pillar of Autumn.

496
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
There's a chance the artifact isn't Covenant at all.

497
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,700
A chance that it's something much more dangerous.

498
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,140
More dangerous than a Covenant superweapon?

499
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,980
Much more dangerous.

500
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,020
Yeah, the artifact is some sort of timer.

501
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,160
It's like counting down.

502
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,380
Counting down to what?

503
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,940
Counting down to what, Jersey?

504
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,120
No one knows, Jan.

505
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,700
No one wants to find out.

506
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,180
We've got to get into Chala Base and turn it off.

507
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,360
Why not tell the Navy?

508
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,360
They won't believe us.

509
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,100
But you do?

510
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,980
I do.

511
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,320
Okay, then I do too.

512
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,920
So you help us break into Chala?

513
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,320
Jersey, look, breaking into a military base is buggier than even my mother.

514
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,420
Why not just contact the authorities?

515
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,380
Call the press.

516
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,680
Because there are a whole shipload of people who knew about this.

517
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,420
And they're all either dead or shipped to the front lines.

518
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,600
If you try to tell the press, you'll end up in front of a bus.

519
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,040
Wait, I met a guy like that.

520
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,240
McCaskill.

521
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,720
Yes, he ran the tool crib on the Apocalypse Zone.

522
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,720
Okay, so he wasn't just paranoid.

523
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,960
Sucks, doesn't he?

524
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,020
Jan, you owe me.

525
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,620
I know.

526
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,560
So let me get this straight.

527
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,860
You want us to break into Chala Base, find this thing, and shut it down?

528
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,400
Yes.

529
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,820
That sounds impossible to me.

530
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,380
So you in?

531
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,280
Of course.

532
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,700
Hello?

533
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,520
McCaskill, good.

534
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,680
You must have the wrong…

535
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,220
Disconnect, and I'll tell Section 3 where you are.

536
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,220
Damn it.

537
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,380
You had just bad luck, you know that?

538
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,960
I'm already as good as dead.

539
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,440
Don't think I'd give a damn about taking you with me.

540
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,560
My life hasn't been worth a dry man's spit since we had our first little chat before the Apocalypse Zone shipped out.

541
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,380
What can I say?

542
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,040
I have a way with people.

543
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,260
When the whole thing started to go down, I was just a little kid.

544
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,520
When the whole thing started to go down, I tried to squirt your note.

545
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,420
Did you know that?

546
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,060
The op busted me up for it pretty good.

547
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,660
It was the right thing to do.

548
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,780
Yeah, sure.

549
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,380
Only you'd be mama McCaskill's little boy getting the long sleep if she had ratted me out.

550
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,000
Not you.

551
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,340
We have to talk about the artifact you beheld on the Apocalypse Zone.

552
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,940
I hate this light of needles.

553
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,360
I can't even give blood.

554
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,060
McCaskill, it took a lot of work to seek you out.

555
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,860
I need to know how they triggered it.

556
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,320
Everything depends on it.

557
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,580
I told the investigators.

558
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,300
I don't know nothing about nothing.

559
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't know what they'll do if I give them your location.

560
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,600
Maybe a hard sound pulse to drop you while you're crossing the street.

561
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,560
Or gas.

562
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,740
They're using gas more these days.

563
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,660
I was just messing around.

564
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,200
I could have these shapes on it, you know?

565
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,280
Triangles and lines and dots.

566
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,980
I wasn't even thinking about it.

567
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Just a nervous habit.

568
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,720
I got bad nerves.

569
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,460
Right, and?

570
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,520
They went all the way around like the tread on a tire.

571
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,580
I don't know why.

572
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,080
I just touched all the triangles first.

573
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,000
The official app team had given up.

574
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,560
They couldn't get nothing out of it.

575
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,300
Triangles all the way around.

576
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,660
Then lines.

577
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,360
Then dots.

578
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,800
Then kablam!

579
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,300
Triangles, lines, dots.

580
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,280
Sam, I'm empty.

581
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,100
If it makes you feel any better about revealing the truth, you may have just saved the planet.

582
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,960
Then maybe the planet can buy me a drink.

583
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,280
Oh, this is crazy.

584
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:31,860
Hello?

585
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,440
Oh, it's you.

586
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,520
Um, so, I mean, I don't really know what I can do, but, um, I-

587
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,460
Listen, if you walk through this door, there's just one freaking rule.

588
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,100
No busting on my mom's apartment!

589
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:49,920
Got it?

590
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,560
Uh, sure.

591
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,040
Geez, is that so much to ask?

592
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,740
Jen, Jen, you got some soup order or something at your place?

593
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,620
Nope.

594
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,460
Sorry.

595
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,420
Wow, there's a hole in your wall.

596
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,940
It's running for you.

597
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,600
Oh, he's thinking.

598
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,500
Jersey.

599
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,320
Manners.

600
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,020
Manners?

601
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,220
I gotta get this fixed before my mom gets back.

602
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,640
You need some liquid plywood.

603
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,200
You can get it at the hardware.

604
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,120
Hi, my name's Kamal.

605
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,840
Oh, I am so sorry about Coral.

606
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,460
How did you know that I was from Coral?

607
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,600
Don't even ask.

608
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,340
Okay, college boy's right, Ronnie.

609
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,000
I should be nice to you.

610
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,480
Can I get you anything?

611
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,260
Um, something to drink would be great.

612
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,300
Kitchen's right through there.

613
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
Watch your step, though.

614
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,960
I don't think Kamal got all the-

615
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,880
The last time I swept up all the glass!

616
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,940
Hey, you must be the brave one.

617
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,720
I'm Jan.

618
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,300
Uh, beg your pardon?

619
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,300
Jan, short for Janissary.

620
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,100
No, I meant- never mind.

621
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,360
Oh, what, brave?

622
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,660
Not what most people would say.

623
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,460
Not what I would say.

624
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,260
Hold on, you're an ONI analyst who's about to help us break into a Navy base.

625
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,480
What's the penalty for that?

626
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,380
Induced coma.

627
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:10,120
Now, my whole family seems to have some kind of death wish, and Kamal, from what I gather, doesn't have a hell of a lot left to live for.

628
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,460
But to risk all that based on one of Jersey's plans?

629
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,720
That looks like brave to me.

630
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,220
Well, I guess.

631
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,600
I mean, I hadn't really thought of one of Jersey's plans.

632
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,680
You want something to drink?

633
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,020
Uh, sure.

634
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,460
Just don't read the ingredients.

635
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,020
Oh, I never do.

636
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,300
Okay, come into the living room.

637
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,500
Let's do this thing.

638
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,560
I guess the women folks supposed to come out of the kitchen now.

639
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,500
Hmm, this should be amusing if nothing else.

640
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,400
By the way-

641
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,780
Yeah?

642
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:42,880
I like your hair.

643
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,740
So the short version is, the artifact is at Chala.

644
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,940
It is counting down and it must be stopped.

645
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,700
If that's true, why doesn't this…

646
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,120
Standish guy see that?

647
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,600
He has a great deal invested in another answer, Kamal.

648
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,020
He believes he has a prototype of the next generation of Covenant weapons.

649
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,640
All of the enemy's secrets.

650
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,240
If only he can unlock them.

651
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,420
But why would he keep going down this path so blindly?

652
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,480
It's not about being smart.

653
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,400
It's about having killed people.

654
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,360
Once you start killing people, you better have been right.

655
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,720
If it is counting down, what do you think it'll do?

656
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:28,040
The last time it was triggered, the shockwave flatlined communications throughout the solar system for more than seven seconds.

657
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,360
They're good as you know, but she thinks it'll probably be bad.

658
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,340
Thanks for the translation.

659
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,960
Don't mention it, college boy.

660
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,320
No problem, high school kid.

661
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,700
Or haven't you graduated yet?

662
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,040
Boys…

663
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,620
We need to get to the artifact and turn it off.

664
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,260
Trouble is, Chala base is a totally self-contained and secure system.

665
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,740
Like crystal security?

666
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,700
Times ten.

667
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,900
I'll have to port in through chatter and get physically patched into Chala.

668
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,140
To be honest, there's a chance the lab itself is another black box.

669
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,480
Ronnie, can you tell us which building the lab is in?

670
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,180
41, I think.

671
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,240
But that's red security.

672
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,960
I don't have clearance to enter that part of the base, let alone get into the lab.

673
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,240
No problem, Durga.

674
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,300
You know, I've been thinking about this and I've got a plan.

675
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,040
Jersey, you've got a plan to get in Chala.

676
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,540
What, you think I'm not the hero type?

677
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,040
Jersey…

678
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,120
Trust me, it's gonna work.

679
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,200
You're not the only one who comes from a military family, remember?

680
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,940
Jersey, your dad is in the Signal Corps.

681
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,560
Oni Signal Corps.

682
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,700
Crazy like a fox, baby.

683
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
So what's the plan?

684
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,100
I go in as a pizza delivery guy.

685
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,020
What?

686
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,860
Hey, Navy guys love pizza.

687
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,860
Then Kamau goes in as a chatter network repair guy and he's got the chatter link for Durga.

688
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,460
And Jan goes in as a recruit.

689
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,560
As if.

690
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,320
Hey, live the fantasy, that's all I'm saying.

691
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,580
You can't deliver pizza in a secure area.

692
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,420
Yeah, I know that.

693
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,060
So we get in, I'm delivering pies to the civilian base like you're building.

694
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,540
But there we change into our special forces uniforms.

695
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,120
Special forces uniforms.

696
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,040
Right, the ones Durga will order up for us tonight.

697
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,080
We change in the bathroom, then Durga creates a diversion like you did with the auditor.

698
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,740
Jersey, I just said I can't get inside Chala.

699
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,820
So you make the diversion right outside Chala.

700
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,660
Like, I don't know, maybe there's something like an accident in a circus, the midget clowns riding unicycles with their hair on fire.

701
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,900
I don't know, just stick with the big picture here.

702
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,000
Jersey, I'm not sure that that is a…

703
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,960
Then we trip every alarm we can find, and an even more confusing total chaos.

704
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,940
We find the artifact, we trigger it, and then Durga calls for the building to be evacuated.

705
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,420
Um, what about the part where they shoot you trying to get into building 41?

706
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,020
That's where Jan comes in.

707
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:46,860
Me?

708
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,980
Jersey, tactically speaking, this plan leaves somewhere…

709
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,420
Okay, better than the pizza delivery thing, we're all in a band.

710
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,380
A band?

711
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,740
Yeah, for the officers club, like a retirement party.

712
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,540
If Jan was in a slinky red dress, the guy at the gate won't even care if we're on some list or not.

713
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,700
Jersey…

714
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,580
She could have a gun strapped to her garter belt, and a clip of ammo between…

715
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,380
Or maybe somebody else has a better idea?

716
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,340
Oh god, I hope so.

717
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,300
Ronnie, I can show you the base layout.

718
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,340
We're gonna need a strategy for getting into building 41.

719
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,540
Do they ever do fire drills, inspections?

720
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,780
Security sweeps.

721
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,360
Nice.

722
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,900
Durga, we're gonna need some orders…

723
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,720
Orders for building security, got it.

724
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,260
If we're patching you in like at Crystal Security, we'll need to know where to make the patch.

725
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,280
Telecom shack.

726
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,360
Ronnie, do you know where those are located?

727
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,360
They're at least three out in the low security part of the base.

728
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,900
Pizza delivery guy.

729
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,000
Ah, just had to break the ice.

730
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,620
Girls like Jan and Durga, they feel better if they're bailing on some hapless guy.

731
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,600
You know how to play the part, I'll give you that.

732
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,360
Hey, I may be dumb, but I ain't stupid.

733
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:55,840
Want a beer?

734
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,400
Are you even old enough to drink that?

735
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,680
I can't fight anymore.

736
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,220
My mom's gonna kill me as it is.

737
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,720
And then we can use the flash grenades.

738
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,780
No, I'm serious.

739
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,340
Oh, man.
