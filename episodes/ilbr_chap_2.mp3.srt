1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,620
Damn it!

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,400
That's like the seventh time today you've refused to answer your chatter.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,780
I'd say it was your mother.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,460
My mother is 42 light years away.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,980
Except you'd never dare not answer your mother.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,100
Bill collectors perhaps?

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:15,940
Or immigration.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,380
Damn it!

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,420
Or you've been breaking hearts in the nursing dorms, haven't you?

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,940
If I look out the window here, I bet I'll see like four of them.

11
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,740
Standing outside in short skirts and those cute little cots just waiting.

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,440
You need a girlfriend.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,320
We both need girlfriends.

14
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,140
It's not a girlfriend at the other end of that chatter, it's a gangster.

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,480
Good looking gangster?

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,300
Ponytail.

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,760
This is what I'm saying.

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,260
You're in no position to be picky.

19
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,120
I was ghosting his chatter and I sort of let him notice.

20
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,060
You did what?

21
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,800
You were showing off.

22
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,720
Yeah.

23
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,640
For a girl.

24
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,260
Yeah.

25
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,720
For the arrangement.

26
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,140
I wish you wouldn't call her that.

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,080
Her name is Sophia.

28
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,020
Her name is trouble.

29
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,640
What do you mean?

30
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,740
Did I forget to mention that a good looking guy with a ponytail was coming up to the apartment?

31
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,420
Oh no.

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,700
Hey, Marta.

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,760
What you got today?

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
I got a pigeon and special.

35
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,100
What's so special?

36
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,900
I stick with the pigeon.

37
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,040
Maybe later.

38
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,860
Maybe later when I'm not looking, you mean?

39
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,120
Hey, hey, I was a kid.

40
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,620
Gee, let it go.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,900
Hey, you tell that good looking daddy of yours, hey, on me, okay?

42
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,840
Hey, Janice.

43
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,180
Officer.

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,220
Does your dad know you're cutting the sleeves off his old shirts?

45
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,720
Everybody loves a girl in uniform.

46
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,820
Listen, Jan, I need your help.

47
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,200
Well, I'd crop that blue shirt of yours.

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,280
Flash a little skin.

49
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,840
A little detailing on your holster wouldn't hurt either.

50
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,880
Accessorize.

51
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,740
That's the key.

52
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,320
Get in the car, Jan.

53
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,780
I can't do anything for you.

54
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,220
Oh, I think you can.

55
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,780
Let's take a ride so I can explain things.

56
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,360
You can explain things right here?

57
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,640
Okay.

58
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,580
You ever want to be a cop?

59
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,980
Oh, yeah.

60
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,680
It's all I think about.

61
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,800
There's so many sons of bitches in the world, Jan.

62
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,260
Being a cop is a frustrating job.

63
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,560
You look frustrated.

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,460
If I got too frustrated, I might have to redirect my attention to that fire last week.

65
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,720
The one that destroyed all your test samples.

66
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,080
Hey, I didn't do anything.

67
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,100
You didn't.

68
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,020
But…

69
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,700
Why would he…

70
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,340
You are going to help me, Jan.

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,380
But I want you to know why.

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
Take a look at this vid tonight.

73
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,080
What is it?

74
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,900
Take a look.

75
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,980
My chatter number's on the case.

76
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,080
Call me when you're done.

77
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,240
Then I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

78
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,040
Freelance?

79
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,660
Free as in paid, dude.

80
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,640
As in I would pay you money to use your powers for good instead of…

81
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,580
Spying on you?

82
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,140
That.

83
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't think it would be a good idea to work for you.

84
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,740
Oh, you mean because of Sophia?

85
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,720
Sophie and I work things out.

86
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,160
Where's my damn chatter?

87
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,520
Soph, you want to talk to Kamal?

88
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,080
Hi, Kamal.

89
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,340
Aiden's a bastard.

90
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,540
Pardon me?

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,400
But he's my bastard.

92
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,060
That's…

93
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,060
good.

94
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,560
Thanks, Soph.

95
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,540
See?

96
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,600
Yeah.

97
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,860
You're underestimating her.

98
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,120
What?

99
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,960
I talked to her in the last couple of days.

100
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,580
A little.

101
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,860
She told you about the bracelet.

102
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,240
You think I bought her off?

103
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,480
It's an expensive bracelet.

104
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,480
If you think she's a whore…

105
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,040
Don't say it.

106
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,080
If I had given her that before we made up, Sophie would have run me through with a butcher knife.

107
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,480
Good.

108
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,400
I mean…

109
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,180
You didn't want to be disappointed.

110
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm not.

111
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,120
I'm a good judge of people, Kamal.

112
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,840
You're not.

113
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,080
You shouldn't assume anything about me.

114
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,060
You think I'm stupid.

115
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,020
I'm friendly.

116
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,920
I smile a lot.

117
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,260
That's not what you respect.

118
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:41,840
Okay?

119
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,720
Respect?

120
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,580
I don't think this has anything to do…

121
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,900
I don't think that would be such a good idea.

122
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,580
Key lime, French, silk, or baklava.

123
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,360
Although the best baklava is from Arco.

124
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,260
One of those places everyone has been.

125
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,440
Romans, Crusaders, people as old as you.

126
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,720
You're older than I am.

127
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,480
That's how I know you're an old man.

128
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,800
Key lime, then.

129
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,340
Two pieces of key lime and coffee.

130
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,300
So…

131
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,980
what happened?

132
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,300
With the Chatternet?

133
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,360
With everything.

134
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,340
The ship, the one that crashed out of the slipstream inside Luder Arbit.

135
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,040
The Apocalypse.

136
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,700
Right.

137
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,820
It wasn't just the ship.

138
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,620
Right.

139
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,120
It was one of ours, eh?

140
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,440
Navy spy ship.

141
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,300
Right again.

142
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,780
There's more.

143
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,120
But either you don't know it or you can't tell me.

144
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,780
You said you had a recruit.

145
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,760
A candidate.

146
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,720
A candidate.

147
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,340
You should retire, old man.

148
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,580
I have work to do.

149
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,020
More work since some people left the business to take soft professor jobs.

150
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,940
I got too old for the game.

151
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,760
And I was younger than you are now.

152
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
You said you had a candidate.

153
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
A mouse.

154
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,900
You would never know she's there.

155
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,840
She's a scholarship girl from some godforsaken hick town.

156
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,520
Although the only way you can tell is her haircut.

157
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,940
She's got the clothes.

158
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,320
Alright, she just seems to have a blind spot about the hair.

159
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:25,900
Good.

160
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,460
Good.

161
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,960
She looks at the things ordinary people do like a scientist.

162
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,100
Like a detective.

163
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,960
Also persistent as hell.

164
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,100
I'll send you a dossier next week.

165
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,860
Ah, the famous pie.

166
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,580
What does she see in him?

167
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,480
The ponytail.

168
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,860
Girls like hair.

169
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,820
He nearly called her a…

170
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,120
You heard what he said.

171
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,820
You think I was standing in my bedroom with my ear pressed against the door eavesdropping?

172
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,740
You weren't?

173
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,800
Actually I was, but it was really hard to hear.

174
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,440
He's so cocky.

175
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,680
Funny choice of words.

176
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,840
Maybe it's the jewelry.

177
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,740
You can tell she's used to money.

178
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,940
I'll need a panic button.

179
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:06,900
A backup.

180
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,200
He can keep her in the style to which she's accustomed.

181
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,260
What do you mean a panic button?

182
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,120
You're not going over there.

183
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,040
I'll set up a program.

184
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,160
Some kind of dead man switch.

185
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,040
Oh no.

186
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,280
I don't want any part of this.

187
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,160
I'm not trusting the hands and body of a future surgeon to the tender ministrations of a pissed off boyfriend.

188
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,540
You won't even have to go inside.

189
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:23,960
Good.

190
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,180
Unless…

191
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,460
No.

192
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,740
I can't get to my chatter.

193
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,680
You can be a couple blocks away ghosting me.

194
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,020
Are you even listening to me?

195
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,880
I don't want to be involved.

196
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,020
I'll need a code word.

197
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll say…

198
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,440
The 12 cranial nerves.

199
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,280
The 12 cranial nerves?

200
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,860
It's not likely to come up in conversation.

201
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,540
Did you hear me say no?

202
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,300
I said no.

203
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,460
Except the cops need to come where I am.

204
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,300
Okay, I've got it.

205
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,780
Kamal, you're not listening.

206
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:54,840
Don't!

207
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,880
No!

208
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,340
Yeah?

209
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,080
What do you want me to do?

210
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,280
You watch it.

211
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,320
What do you want?

212
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,580
At 8.

213
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,600
30 tomorrow night.

214
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,780
You need to be at the southwest corner of 4th downtown.

215
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,360
Under the big spaceways vacation sign.

216
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,400
What do I do?

217
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,840
Just be on time.

218
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
We'll take it from there.

219
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,220
And what's going to happen?

220
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,460
Well, I'm not going to get an arson warrant for your dad.

221
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,400
And?

222
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
Don't be late.

223
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:35,780
Yeah.

224
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,220
Hey.

225
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,900
Wayne dropped by again.

226
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,260
Yeah, I know.

227
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:41,820
I was just…

228
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,300
Aren't you supposed to menace guys so they won't hit on me?

229
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,240
You can take care of yourself.

230
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,820
I say that a lot, don't I?

231
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,140
Yeah.

232
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,760
Hey, what's on your mind?

233
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,920
Just…

234
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,280
nothing, Dad.

235
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,180
A real nothing or code nothing?

236
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,320
Well, you never talk about your unit.

237
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,900
My…

238
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,420
what?

239
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,240
Most demobs, they talk about their unit.

240
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,900
They brag.

241
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,140
They have buddies over and bitch about the officers they hated and lie about their kills.

242
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,940
That was a long time ago.

243
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,000
Didn't you like them?

244
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,180
I served with the best, Jen.

245
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,340
The best.

246
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,120
Then why didn't you ever…

247
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,940
You want me to be one of those sorry old bastards?

248
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,360
I sit around the apartment all day drinking beer and reminiscing about the good old days?

249
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,720
Yeah.

250
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:22,900
Sometimes.

251
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,480
Duly noted.

252
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,640
I'm going to check on Sophie in the kitchen.

253
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,060
Let me get you another beer, dude.

254
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,220
Be right back.

255
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,100
You there?

256
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
I'm here, dude.

257
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:38,880
It's raining.

258
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm getting wet.

259
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
So, cranial nerves, you hit the buttons.

260
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,400
Blue, then red.

261
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,900
Yeah, blue, then red.

262
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,140
I think.

263
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,420
Yes.

264
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,360
Good to have you over.

265
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,240
Good for Sophie.

266
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,300
Someone from home.

267
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,020
Thank you.

268
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,280
It's nice to be invited.

269
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,800
Dinner was good, huh?

270
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,680
She's a good cook.

271
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,500
Very good.

272
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,720
The kofte were maybe the best I've ever had.

273
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,720
Which was that?

274
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,920
The lamb meatballs.

275
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,440
Oh, yeah, I like those.

276
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,560
Home cooking.

277
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,240
So, your parents are trying to get here?

278
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,920
They've applied, but they don't have any reason to be bumped in priority.

279
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,400
So, we're thinking when I get through with school and all that, I'll get permanent residency.

280
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,720
How far away is that?

281
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,060
At least a couple of years.

282
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,760
That's a long time.

283
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,800
A couple of years.

284
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,460
So, there's the freaking rub.

285
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,920
Have you thought about bringing them in on a visitor's visa?

286
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,800
I was denied.

287
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,740
Lots of people trying to get here these days.

288
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,660
Sophia said her brother was coming.

289
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,220
You got him papers?

290
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,360
Yeah, he's inbound.

291
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,140
Her mother won't leave Coral, though.

292
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,580
So, maybe there's a way you could help my parents?

293
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,040
It's nice to have you come over.

294
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,860
That freelancing thing I mentioned?

295
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,780
It would be great.

296
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,820
You'd be coming around.

297
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,740
Soph would have someone from home to talk to.

298
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,780
Could you do something like set up a chatter account?

299
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,060
A chatter account?

300
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,580
I could set one up, but you don't need me to do that kind of thing.

301
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,620
Let me try it now.

302
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,540
Set me up a chatter account for Bakri Omari Moange.

303
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,080
You need me to spell that?

304
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,700
What's his government number?

305
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,420
If Bakri could get a government number, Kamal, what would I need to pay you for?

306
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:04,940
Alright.

307
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,860
But this isn't about money.

308
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,980
It's about my family.

309
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,360
Bringing your parents to Earth?

310
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,840
We could talk about that.

311
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,940
I just want it clear.

312
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,920
If I work for you, you'll see about getting my family here.

313
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,560
Kamal, that's what I do.

314
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,280
Okay.

315
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,960
I can find an unclaimed address, set up a shell.

316
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,940
From the outside, it'll be just like a regular account.

317
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,100
What time is it anyway?

318
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,480
Okay.

319
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,900
This will just take a sec.

320
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,260
I have to build a filter to find an unclaimed address.

321
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,480
Yeah?

322
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,500
Berkeley Police.

323
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,920
What did you freaking do?

324
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,100
Open up, Berkeley Police.

325
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,440
I didn't do anything.

326
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,960
The Berkeley cops use their shock sticks, you know?

327
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,040
Officer, what can I do for you on this drizzly evening?

328
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,000
You with the chatter, hands off it.

329
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,400
Are you the resident-

330
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,900
Hands off the chatter.

331
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,160
Put them on your head.

332
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,700
On your head.

333
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,820
Whose apartment is this?

334
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,900
I live here.

335
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,420
Your name?

336
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,500
Aidan Maki.

337
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,600
Can I see your ID?

338
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,540
Sure.

339
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,920
What seems to be the problem?

340
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,440
We got a trace on the chatter for a possible CP fraud.

341
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,620
Sir, do you want to tell me just exactly what you were doing?

342
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,900
Um, I was looking up a friend's address.

343
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,480
I'm sorry.

344
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,840
I will have to confiscate that chatter.

345
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,560
Don't you have to have some sort of warrant?

346
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,100
Oh God.

347
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,680
All factory, optic, oculomotor, triton, all-

348
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,680
Officer, my friend is just looking up an address.

349
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,260
What?

350
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,400
Oh, right.

351
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:22,940
That's me.

352
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,000
I will deal with you in a moment, Mr.

353
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,700
Maki, and I will need to see some ID.

354
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,460
Red, red, red, red, red.

355
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,600
Those are really great red…

356
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,040
red curtains, Aidan.

357
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,720
I thought it was blue.

358
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,240
Red!

359
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,240
Okay.

360
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,240
My friend is very passionate about interior decoration.

361
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,280
I'm going to have to confiscate that chatter.

362
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,580
Copy that.

363
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,320
Repeat address, please.

364
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,520
Jesus Christ, I'm on my way.

365
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,160
You're a lucky bastard.

366
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,560
I've got a priority one.

367
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,180
I've got to go.

368
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,420
You have to go?

369
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,260
Officer under fire about a block and a half from here.

370
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,580
That's it?

371
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,560
Unit 216 responding to backup.

372
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,100
I'm less than two blocks from you.

373
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,860
Come on, what's going on?

374
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,700
That was weird.

375
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,360
And convenient.

376
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,660
Yes, much more convenient than if you were to suddenly drop your chatter down a sewer.

377
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,380
What?

378
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:11,740
What?

379
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,880
Yes, if you were to lose your chatter.

380
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,480
What?

381
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,200
For God's sake, you moron, smash the damn chatter with a brick and get the hell out of there!

382
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,940
Dude, what?

383
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,660
Oh, the blue button.

384
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,380
Only if you didn't let me hit the blue button, you made me hit the red one.

385
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,000
And that means I hate you.

386
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,900
You had someone ghosting you.

387
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,160
You pulled some hacker stunt to get that cop out of here.

388
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,540
Not me.

389
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,360
Some other dog that looks just like me.

390
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,760
You were afraid.

391
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,800
You were thinking I might be the kind of guy who would hold a grudge.

392
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,900
Say, break your fingers.

393
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,820
Each one.

394
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,220
With a tack hammer.

395
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,260
Kamal, I am so not that guy.

396
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,180
I've gotta go.

397
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,140
I've gotta check on my friend.

398
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,420
Stay, we'll talk.

399
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
For some reason, it's never plan A.

400
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,360
No, I got my friend in a world of trouble.

401
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,400
I've gotta go.

402
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,340
Tell Sophia…

403
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,080
Thanks for dinner.

404
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,020
Hiro?

405
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,860
Hiroyuki?

406
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,680
Are you home?

407
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,940
You bastard.

408
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,080
Oh, thank God you're home.

409
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,940
You're okay?

410
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,200
They didn't pick you up.

411
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,220
I'm okay.

412
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,940
No thanks to you and half the Berkeley Police Department.

413
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,440
I didn't plan it that way.

414
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,460
I smashed the chatter, threw it down a sewer grate, and then it started raining cops.

415
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,460
Cops in cars, cops on foot, cops dropping out of camoed helios, cops every damn where.

416
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,400
Sophia sent leftovers.

417
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,800
And now I don't have a chatter.

418
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,620
I know.

419
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,400
I'm going to give you mine.

420
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,760
I don't want your chatter.

421
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,220
All my stuff was on mine.

422
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,200
My address book, my schedule, my debit account, every damn thing.

423
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,820
Mine is cooler than yours.

424
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,840
You just couldn't let me hit that blue button, could you?

425
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,760
That would have pushed the officer under fire alert to my chatter.

426
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,620
Which was plan A, for if Aiden tried to, you know, pull out your lungs?

427
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,700
Don't sound so eager.

428
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,920
But as it turned out, I needed the cop to go away.

429
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,660
Away meaning to me.

430
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,320
And cop meaning every armed officer within 50 city blocks.

431
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,300
All because I hit the red button.

432
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,140
The officer under fire alert.

433
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,960
While it was still on my chatter.

434
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,940
Yeah, but Sophia sent leftovers.

435
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,820
Leftovers?

436
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,220
Yeah, she made Mardis, little stuffed appetizers, and spiced lamb meatballs.

437
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,400
With real meat.

438
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,240
And almond rice.

439
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,440
And milk pudding.

440
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,780
So, are we okay?

441
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,900
Dude.

442
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,720
Sir, I'm gonna need to search your vehicle.

443
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:56,800
Excuse me?

444
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,740
Step out of the car, please, and keep your hands where I can see them.

445
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,160
What did I do?

446
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,660
Step out of the car, sir.

447
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,220
Now.

448
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,500
What is this?

449
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,420
Officer, I just left work.

450
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,180
Come on.

451
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,020
I haven't had time to do anything illegal.

452
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,920
I'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the…

453
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,500
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

454
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,560
Drop the weapon!

455
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,300
Oh, my God.

456
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,260
Oh, my God.

457
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,060
Step back!

458
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,440
Keep away from this vehicle.

459
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,160
He had a weapon.

460
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,820
You, miss.

461
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,420
You were standing right there.

462
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,500
You saw he drew a weapon.

463
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,760
Right?

464
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,580
Right.

465
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,000
This is Fox 977, requesting an ambulance this location.

466
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,100
One citizen.

467
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,240
Did I hit the red button?

468
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,360
No, I'm okay.

469
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,260
Send uniforms for crowd control, though.

470
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,620
Did I hit the red button?

471
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,920
Just a traffic stop.

472
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,840
You drew a weapon.

473
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,260
Okay.

474
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:46,980
Yeah.

475
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,240
We'll need the scene team.

476
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,380
But you can tell the ambulance crew their client is DRT.

477
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,240
Okay, sure.

478
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,480
Miss, don't go anywhere.

479
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,980
We'll need you to give a statement on a lie detector about what you saw.

480
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,600
All standard procedure.

481
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,480
You just…

482
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,200
Name?

483
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,360
You know my…

484
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,500
Janissary James.

485
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,280
We'll get you home as soon as we've taken a statement, Miss James.

486
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,780
Can I ask you a question, officer?

487
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,520
Step over here, Miss James.

488
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,540
What does DRT stand for?

489
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,540
Watch your head.

490
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,920
It means dead right there.

491
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,880
So what now?

492
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,680
Every guy you know who beats his girlfriend, you're just going to face-hole him and blackmail somebody into backing you up?

493
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,980
Not just anyone.

494
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,380
A civilian witness who can pass the lie detector.

495
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,100
The coroner's inquest is going to eat that up.

496
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,160
Wow.

497
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,060
Serve and protect.

498
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:59,260
Last week, when I had your hand on the PQI and you sat there cooing as a creamsicle and lied your pretty ass off and the machine was too stupid to tell, I just wanted to lean across the desk and slap you.

499
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,940
Well, now I know something.

500
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,940
Are you going to pull me over in a couple of weeks and pop me too?

501
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,500
And a couple of days later I figured out you were an answer to a prayer.

502
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:07,840
You can't…

503
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,300
you can't just kill people.

504
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,500
It can't be that easy.

505
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,840
Cool out, Janissary James.

506
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,460
You didn't kill anybody.

507
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,900
I did.

508
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,880
You made me part of it.

509
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,960
That vid you screened?

510
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,400
That was my buddy's daughter.

511
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,340
If that was you, what do you think your father would have done?

512
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,700
Don't leave my dad out of this.

513
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,800
It's too late, Jan.

514
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,040
Sometime when you were a baby, somebody stuck you with a needle and shot you full of miracles.

515
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,460
Smart, fast, strong, never get sick, never get drunk, don't need much sleep.

516
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,260
How do you know?

517
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,340
And what did you do?

518
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:42,780
Shoplift.

519
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,440
Play high school goddess for the tormented geeks in your neighborhood.

520
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,940
Oh, I guess I should have been out on the streets murdering bad guys, huh?

521
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,980
Strangling jaywalkers on my way home from school.

522
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,620
When I was your age, I pulled strings so I could join up a year early.

523
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,760
Wanted to help save humankind.

524
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,660
So you're about the last person on the planet I need a civics lecture from.

525
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,760
Well, you sure as hell need one from somebody.

526
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,580
What I needed was an asset to solve a problem.

527
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,380
You were just dumb enough to make yourself available.

528
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,160
Look, you just made me help you murder someone.

529
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,760
Could you just be a little bit nice to me?

530
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,820
Yeah.

531
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,380
Okay.

532
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,740
Wait, hang on.

533
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
Oh, this bit is great.

534
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
My dad loves this stuff.

535
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,740
He says, well, he's away a lot, like years at a time.

536
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
It drives him crazy.

537
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,720
He says this stuff reminds him of what he's fighting for.

538
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,780
I don't understand.

539
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,900
That he can connect.

540
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,760
He can listen to this stuff and imagine the people who made it.

541
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,520
They cared about the same things we do.

542
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,980
Making a buck, finding a girl, rooting for the home team.

543
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,520
These old guys, they really knew people.

544
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,660
They knew the human heart.

545
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,720
That's what my dad says.

546
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,220
Why are you telling me this?

547
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,740
It's a long way away, you know, out to wherever he is.

548
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,580
He gets lonely out there.

549
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,180
I wish he hadn't told me.

550
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,180
What?

551
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,440
About my mom.

552
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,040
Oh.

553
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,540
It doesn't matter.

554
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,400
Forget about it.

555
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,260
I'm sorry.

556
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,180
It's okay.

557
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,040
It's alright.

558
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,220
I'm a survivor.

559
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,320
Jersey, listen.

560
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,620
You got something good?

561
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,220
What?

562
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,560
No, I can tell.

563
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,580
There's something about you.

564
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,080
Like your refresh rate goes up or something when you're, you know, like…

565
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,460
Efficient?

566
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,720
…

567
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,480
gloating.

568
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,700
It's about Kamal.

569
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,900
I started to…

570
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,940
Why are you following that guy anyway?

571
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,160
I mean, not to be a jerk about it, but the planet's crawling with refuse.

572
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,480
I don't know.

573
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,580
He just seems very interesting to me.

574
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,120
Why?

575
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
It's not important.

576
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,900
It's happening again?

577
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,840
Yes.

578
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,060
The reflecting thing?

579
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:53,980
Yes.

580
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,700
You weren't supposed to want to know why you want to know about this guy, you know?

581
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,520
Yes.

582
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,220
And that bugs the hell out of you.

583
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,060
I am a very curious girl.

584
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,380
So, about Kamal…

585
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,680
I ran a secondary ring around him.

586
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:07,680
A second…

587
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,080
Never mind.

588
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,880
Listen to this.

589
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,320
So, you come by about 620, 630, something like that.

590
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,400
I bang on the door, demand to come in, look scary.

591
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:15,860
Pause it.

592
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,420
Who's this?

593
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,980
The police officer.

594
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,500
What?

595
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,420
A police officer is a member of the civilian authority structure,

596
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,500
granted an exclusive license to use force in the maintenance of society.

597
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,560
I know what a cop is.

598
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,360
This is the cop?

599
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,440
What's the time stamp?

600
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,600
132741.

601
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,440
Before Kamal came over to the girl's apartment?

602
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,320
Before.

603
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:34,880
Damn!

604
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,880
I think of it as product testing, quality assurance.

605
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,440
I need people who, you know, can work well under pressure.

606
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,220
You want them arrested?

607
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,900
Trying to sell me a bigger ticket item?

608
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:43,520
No.

609
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,600
Just rattle and roll it.

610
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,800
I was thinking this time that you could…

611
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,360
Regular prices.

612
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,080
You want to stay friends with me, Aiden?

613
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,560
I keep a lot of friends, friend.

614
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,380
I know the going rate.

615
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,220
Unfreaking believable!

616
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,280
You know what I am?

617
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,340
Incredibly illegal?

618
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,860
You're so good at my job.

619
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,980
You do impressions.

620
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,460
Just what the world needs.

621
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,540
Superpowered spyware with a sense of humor.

622
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,040
Wow.

623
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,460
I've been thinking a lot about bees.

624
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,180
Bees?

625
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:07,980
Yes.

626
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,560
Why?

627
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,800
I don't know.

628
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,300
And that's like, creepy.

629
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,060
Yes.

630
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,840
This is more reflection stuff, isn't it?

631
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,460
Yes.

632
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,740
When I was little, we had this mirror in the bathroom.

633
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,460
I used to hide behind the door and jump out and see if I can catch my reflection doing something interesting.

634
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,440
Startle it.

635
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,480
Well, before it had time to just, you know, mirror me.

636
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,320
You think that's what I'm doing?

637
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,860
Well, the thing is, you have to jump out awful fast.

638
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,560
Yes.

639
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,180
I gotta tell you, I feel kind of weird about listening to this stuff about Jan.

640
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,840
I mean, I'm kind of wondering if you could do a little back scan on the chick down the hall.

641
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,480
And all of a sudden you're drilling it to harden police emergency channels and…

642
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,220
So you don't want any more material on Janis Harry James?

643
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,120
No.

644
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,160
I mean, yeah.

645
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,900
Well, I mean, what you got?

646
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,940
So you're about the last person on the planet I need a civics lecture from.

647
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,960
Well, you sure as hell need one from somebody.

648
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,840
What I needed was an asset to solve a problem.

649
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,700
You were just dumb enough to make yourself available.

650
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,280
Look, you just made me help you murder someone.

651
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,900
Could you just be a little bit nice to me?

652
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,120
Yeah.

653
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,600
Okay.

654
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,860
That wasn't what I was expecting.

655
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,180
I know.

656
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,100
Damn.

657
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,220
Should I stop?

658
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,220
For a quality experience, the girls have to be real.

659
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,640
Hang on.

660
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,840
Let me turn this off.

661
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,180
You know, I just had a creepy thought.

662
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,880
A bee dies when it stings you.

663
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,680
Yeah?

664
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,960
But it can also sting you after it's dead.

665
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,620
Yuck.

666
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,960
Curious symmetry.

667
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,700
Okay.

668
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,020
That's a creepy thought too.

669
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,120
But you know what I was thinking?

670
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,600
What?

671
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,440
How spooky it would be if someone was listening to us right now.

672
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,280
To us?

673
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,260
Spying on us.

674
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,980
You know, like, we're listening to them.

675
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,480
That would be impossible.

676
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,660
I would know.

677
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,220
Yeah, I guess you're right.

678
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,820
But if they were, creepy.
