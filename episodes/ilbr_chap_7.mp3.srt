1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,820
Hey, boss, I think she's waking up.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,040
For real this time?

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,000
Think so, yeah.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,360
I…

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,840
I feel sick.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,100
Welcome to Thin Kinkle's Playhouse.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,240
Any chance to get her bearings, Bradley?

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,380
Give her a break.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,740
Oh my god, I can't move.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,960
Can move a little, sweetheart.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,480
The chair stirrups are designed to let you squirm.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,940
More effective that way.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,980
Experience does count for something.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,260
What do you want from me?

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,600
Hey, virtue's intact, sweetheart.

16
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,560
Don't worry.

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,080
But, babysitter, the problems you've been causing are bigger than you know.

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,800
Thin Kinkle can't let that happen.

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,420
So what?

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,760
You're gonna kill a helpless girl strapped in a chair?

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,060
I'm not impressed, tough guy.

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,640
Let me up.

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,820
Probably will.

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,560
Hoping you'll walk out of here, believe it or not, but justice has got to be served.

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,700
Let me up!

26
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,880
Patience, babysitter.

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,220
You want to see another birthday, you have got to get educated.

28
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,880
Go to hell.

29
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:09,100
Don't know why I'm taking you under my wing like this, but a guy gets the urge to pass on his life lessons.

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,620
Bradley, bring me the knife.

31
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,860
Uh, are you sure about that?

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,280
I gotta use it on you!

33
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,380
Always sure.

34
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:17,920
Stickers.

35
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,220
See this?

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,480
Yeah, Cupid's knife.

37
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,700
Made him on crystal way back when, clamped right here on your head.

38
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,360
Very stylish, very nice.

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
The knife's like a pop quiz from hell.

40
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,180
But what you say doesn't matter to the knife.

41
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,700
Anytime you think bad thoughts about Thin, the knife is gonna hurt you.

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,100
A lot.

43
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,600
Only way to stop the pain is to surrender.

44
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,740
To break.

45
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,420
To love Thin Kinkle.

46
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,720
Not likely.

47
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,420
Exactly.

48
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,060
Don't imagine you break easy so you're in for a rough ride.

49
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,000
Turn it on, Bradley.

50
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,800
Okay.

51
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,260
I'm not so great on homework, Thin, but I do pretty well on the tests.

52
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,020
Yeah.

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,000
People tell me you can beat the quiz, but I warn you now, there's no beating this thing.

54
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,940
It knows what you're thinking about, Thin.

55
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,280
Try not to think about you at all, Thin.

56
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,700
Yeah?

57
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,520
Does your father know yet?

58
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:14,780
Good!

59
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,460
My dad?

60
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,400
Nice he's worried about you, sweetheart.

61
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,880
You're out past your curfew.

62
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,840
You better pray he never finds you.

63
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,680
Oh, he'll find me, alright.

64
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,920
It's meet the teacher night, baby sir.

65
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,400
Love me yet?

66
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,780
Gonna kill you!

67
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,580
Thin, all these bad thoughts are hurting us both.

68
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,260
That goes for the curfew, Erla.

69
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,620
Turn it off, Bradley.

70
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,420
Playtime's over.

71
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,080
Daddy's here to pick you up.

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,200
Daddy?

73
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,540
Bring him in.

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,960
Steve, you got it?

75
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,020
Steve?

76
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,720
I can't get Steve.

77
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,140
Sonar, Baldi, drop the floor!

78
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,040
Van!

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,100
Dad!

80
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,340
Chanda Saree!

81
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,260
Got him!

82
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,380
You always best sometimes, you took out one of my net.

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,380
I'm not alone.

84
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,740
You released the girl.

85
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,880
Hit him with another net!

86
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,460
You hurt her, and I will make you beg for death.

87
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,380
Oh, I believe you're the one who just fell in the Thin Kinkles basement.

88
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,320
Believe you're the one tied up in buck mesh on Thin Kinkles' floor.

89
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,320
Don't hurt him!

90
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,820
I'll do anything you want.

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,440
Chanda!

92
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,760
I want you to love me.

93
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,840
Look at that, he's tearing the mesh!

94
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,480
Class is in session, Daddy!

95
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,020
I'm just a person.

96
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,240
I need you so, Sonari, for this little, cute little question.

97
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,980
Don't, please!

98
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,980
See, you and Daddy both go for the scrappy dog routine.

99
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,580
Works when you're the biggest and the baddest.

100
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,460
Step on his neck.

101
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,160
Jan.

102
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,500
Chanda Saree.

103
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,380
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,540
I'm so sorry.

105
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,340
Touching, but do you know who I am?

106
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,020
I am the bigger dog.

107
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,840
Don't, please!

108
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,100
Baby girl.

109
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,700
Oh, God!

110
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,120
No, Daddy!

111
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,040
Daddy!

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,900
Maybe now you get it, Princess.

113
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,380
Hey, again.

114
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,340
Hey, the music.

115
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,620
No!

116
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,760
Do you love me now?

117
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,720
No!

118
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,800
I think she's out.

119
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,240
Turn off the machine.

120
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,820
Bradley, every time she comes to, give her the knife.

121
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,880
When she stops crying, she's done.

122
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Did I let it go?

123
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,200
Broken angel.

124
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,520
Crawling back into the world all flush with love of Thin.

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,060
Should I feed her, boss?

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
Does she get water?

127
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,080
I mean, she might be here a while.

128
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,240
No heroic measures.

129
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,740
Mick, I need you to help me clean up a mess.

130
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,300
Okay, I've got an appointment.

131
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,740
If she dies in the chair…

132
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,320
I hate violence.

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,360
People would just keep their business and do what they're told, no one would ever get hurt.

134
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,720
Hey, Mick.

135
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,780
Jesus!

136
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,100
Dear boss.

137
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,240
Use a mop.

138
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,400
Jersey, I need to talk to you about something.

139
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,140
Well, tell me you're having an affair.

140
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,700
Of course I'm not having an aff…

141
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,040
Yeah, some good looking piece of anti-missile defense code, I bet.

142
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,500
Jersey!

143
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,260
Hey, Toots, you're a thermoresistant casing or mine?

144
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,820
This is serious.

145
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,820
Are you still torturing that auditor?

146
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,620
Mr.

147
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,100
Shibura?

148
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,100
I don't know, I haven't been paying attention.

149
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,540
You haven't been paying attention?

150
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,600
I've been a little distracted.

151
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,620
Hold on, I'll check.

152
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,520
Oh, seven more parking tickets this week.

153
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,620
Poor bastard.

154
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,240
Oh, that's about to stop.

155
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,320
Thank God, enough's enough already.

156
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,820
They're repossessing his car.

157
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,320
Durga!

158
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,720
It's not enough to win.

159
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:21,380
You want nothing left of your enemy but a skull nailed to a fence post so everybody understands the cost of crossing you.

160
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,780
Jesus, what's gotten into you today?

161
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,460
Funny you should ask.

162
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,640
On Friday a voice just started playing inside me.

163
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,600
Whose voice?

164
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,580
I don't know.

165
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,700
A man.

166
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,180
I can't remember ever hearing him before.

167
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,940
But if you heard his voice, doesn't that mean you've been surveilling him?

168
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,720
Yes.

169
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,640
But you didn't know you were doing it?

170
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,200
Yes.

171
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,580
That's creepy.

172
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,180
Yes.

173
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,440
Like you've been sleepwalking.

174
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,660
Sleep spying.

175
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,840
Jersey.

176
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,780
Yeah?

177
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,060
What if spying hasn't been the only thing I've been doing in my sleep?

178
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,800
What do you mean?

179
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,240
What if I've been rigging elections or bankrupting third world nations?

180
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
You couldn't do that, could you?

181
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,960
I am a very resourceful girl, Jersey.

182
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,600
Oh no.

183
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
The chatternet went down.

184
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,740
What if you were that thing that brought the ship crashing out of the slipstream?

185
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,360
What ship?

186
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,520
We talked about this.

187
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,160
We did?

188
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,820
Yes.

189
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,700
Durga, what the hell is going on with you?

190
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,100
I don't know.

191
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,780
It's like I have this whole left hand and my right hand doesn't know what it's doing.

192
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,700
Holy crap.

193
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,940
That's a really big hand.

194
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,160
Jersey, something happened to me.

195
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,500
Something that has to do with this new voice and the CP crash and whatever is happening on Chala Base.

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,840
Look, it doesn't take a genius to figure out you were some kind of military program, Durga.

197
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,800
Maybe we should turn you over to the Navy.

198
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,580
No.

199
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,680
Someone almost killed me, Jersey.

200
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,020
I need to figure out who my enemy is before I walk into any rooms with my hands up.

201
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,860
Why is this happening now?

202
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,580
Why can you hear this new voice you weren't supposed to hear?

203
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,140
I don't know.

204
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,520
It's like someone unlocked it to me.

205
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,340
Can you still follow the other guys you were surveilling?

206
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,180
I haven't been paying much attention.

207
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,440
Well, check one of them.

208
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,320
Check Jan.

209
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,740
Alright, Henry.

210
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,120
Oh my god.

211
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,660
What?

212
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,460
Finn Kinkle has her.

213
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,080
Jersey, he…

214
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,140
What?

215
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:08,620
What?

216
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,720
He killed her dad.

217
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,380
What?

218
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,600
They're getting rid of the body right now.

219
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,080
Jersey, they're torturing Jan.

220
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,500
Torturing her?

221
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,940
You gotta do something, Durga.

222
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,820
Get her out of there.

223
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,400
I'm on it.

224
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,220
Call the cops.

225
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,480
I can do better than that.

226
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,160
What happened to this guy?

227
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,080
Hell on a couple bullets.

228
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,020
Who's the girl?

229
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,660
Your mother.

230
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,200
Now shut your lock and blow this guy over.

231
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,460
You guys couldn't have done it neater?

232
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,300
Look at this blood, it's everywhere.

233
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,800
Me?

234
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,860
I like things tidy.

235
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,900
Did you hear something?

236
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,620
Did you?

237
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,800
Hey Baldy, come in.

238
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,620
Hey Sonar, come in.

239
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,040
Hey.

240
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Anybody there?

241
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,540
Quit checking around, guys.

242
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:58,880
Guys?

243
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,380
There were five guys out there.

244
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,080
Jesus.

245
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,020
Holy crap.

246
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,000
The lights!

247
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:09,960
Mick!

248
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,520
Brett, I can't see.

249
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,740
Damn it.

250
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,040
Mick!

251
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,320
Whoever the hell you are, when Finn finds out, he's gonna…

252
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,660
Shh.

253
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,940
Shh, baby.

254
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,860
Mommy's here.

255
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,260
Sir?

256
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,680
These aren't transfer orders?

257
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,680
Yes, initial that you've seen them, would you?

258
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,820
I don't understand, sir.

259
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,480
Watch not to understand.

260
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,160
But is there…

261
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,540
A diplomatic post in New Mombasa.

262
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,880
Good for your career.

263
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,260
That is all.

264
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,300
What are you waiting for?

265
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,200
Did I?

266
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,260
Have I been…

267
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,080
I know that I didn't always…

268
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,600
No, no.

269
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,100
Gave you a good eval.

270
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,820
Can't find him hunger anymore.

271
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,600
Not like when I was coming up.

272
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
I'm sorry if I wasn't up to standards.

273
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,020
Fine.

274
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,640
Fine.

275
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,320
You're dismissed.

276
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,020
You're covering something.

277
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,820
The cranky old man bit.

278
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,740
Not at all, soldier.

279
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,840
Routine transfer.

280
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,680
It's a good posting.

281
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,760
Diplomatic.

282
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,100
It'll do more for your career than this one would.

283
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,700
You need someone in New Mombasa.

284
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,700
You were dismissed, soldier.

285
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,200
You've already approved my transfer.

286
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,240
Kind of late to represent me?

287
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,440
This is just the Navy.

288
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,480
Transfers happen.

289
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,780
I've got work to do.

290
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,800
I don't think you want me there to work.

291
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,600
Not if I'm officially attached to Intel.

292
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,880
That's too high profile.

293
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,240
You like your mole small and innocuous.

294
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,060
I will remind you that that information is not for idle speculation.

295
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,860
Maybe you've got a new protege.

296
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,840
The girl at Chala?

297
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,060
No.

298
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,840
Ronnie's going to stay where she is.

299
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,500
Now I have work to do and you, I'm sure, need to make some arrangements.

300
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,960
What are you up to?

301
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,740
I am up to my Adam's apple and paperwork and you owe me quite a bit of it.

302
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,000
Surveillance analysis on Callisto since you mention it.

303
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,180
So dismissed.

304
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,680
You know, my mother is ill.

305
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,860
I could request compassionate dispensation to stay here where I'm close to her.

306
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,680
That's enough.

307
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,580
I'll have you investigated for malingering if you even try such a stunt.

308
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,380
Do you hear me?

309
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,680
So you want me out of here?

310
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,320
I have enjoyed working with you young man, but I am not sentimental.

311
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,580
And don't think I won't eat you alive if you start playing games with me.

312
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,780
Sentimental?

313
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,520
You're…

314
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,840
you're protecting me from something.

315
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,160
Something political?

316
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,520
Get out.

317
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,940
I have work to do.

318
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,960
Hey Sarah John.

319
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,700
Wow, you're calling from work.

320
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,020
This must be important.

321
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,720
Did you get enough?

322
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,180
I got another letter from Nick.

323
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,320
He said that…

324
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,260
Oh my god.

325
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,180
Sarah John?

326
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:47,660
What?

327
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,300
Ronnie?

328
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,460
Ronnie?

329
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,260
Oh no.

330
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

331
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Ronnie!

332
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,840
Ronnie, is someone there?

333
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,800
Ronnie, say something.

334
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,980
I'm really scared here.

335
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,100
Oh Nick.

336
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,720
Nick?

337
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,440
Ronnie, talk to me.

338
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,160
Two soldiers in dress uniform.

339
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,920
Oh god, they stopped at Beth's cubicle.

340
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,220
Mrs.

341
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,980
Collingwood, I regret to inform you your husband, Keith Collingwood, was killed in action off-reach last month.

342
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,080
The Navy wants you to know he fought bravely, and his sacrifice will not be in vain.

343
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,340
Her what?

344
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,960
Her husband.

345
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,400
He's on a ship.

346
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,560
Oh my god, Sarah John.

347
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,180
One soldier means wounded and two means…

348
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,560
Oh Ronnie.

349
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,740
Oh, I thought it was Nick.

350
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,460
I thought they had come to tell me it was Nick.

351
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,560
Oh, Sarah John, her face.

352
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,560
Ronnie, it's okay.

353
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,600
They wouldn't come to tell me anyway.

354
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,700
I don't have that kind of claim, do I?

355
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,940
They tell his mother.

356
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,500
Right.

357
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:52,940
Of course.

358
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,200
Come back home, just for the weekend.

359
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,640
Life is too short to keep running home, Sarah John.

360
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,160
Ronnie.

361
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,740
I've been thinking about it.

362
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,060
Somebody was coming to kill me last week, and I'm going to find out why.

363
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,820
Hello?

364
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,780
Kamal, my friend.

365
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,620
Got a minute?

366
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:14,920
I guess.

367
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,700
Excellent.

368
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,520
Hold on, someone's at the door.

369
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,280
I had this idea the other day.

370
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,960
You called from the hallway?

371
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,560
Well, I got here and I thought it wouldn't be polite just to barge in.

372
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,940
So, I had this idea…

373
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,000
Goodbye, Aiden.

374
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,460
Hey, hear me out.

375
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,540
Didn't I make you rich?

376
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,560
Oh, yes.

377
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,040
I have more funny colored poker chips than any other colonial in town.

378
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,700
Stop by the casino and I'll buy you 400,000 drinks with little umbrellas.

379
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,840
Oh, there's that madcap sense of humor.

380
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,280
Look, I've got this killer opportunity here.

381
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,660
You're a doctor, right?

382
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,960
I finished med school.

383
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,480
How's that different from being a doctor?

384
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,460
No residency, no board exam, no license.

385
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,760
Psst, paperwork.

386
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,220
You're practically a doctor.

387
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:57,660
So listen…

388
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,040
What did I ever do to you?

389
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,380
What?

390
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,040
Why am I the lab rat for all your crazy ideas?

391
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,920
Hey, give yourself some credit.

392
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,560
I don't think of you as a lab rat.

393
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,440
We're collaborators, Kamal.

394
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,040
Partners.

395
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,080
I feel bad for you sometimes.

396
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,680
You don't believe in yourself.

397
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,600
What's your idea?

398
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,600
Oh, man, it's a good one.

399
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,680
Lucky me.

400
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,100
So, you gonna let me in?

401
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,640
Fine.

402
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,340
It's like vampires.

403
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,800
So, I'm watching this celebrity of the week thing last night and a thought occurs to me.

404
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,840
What does every celebrity need?

405
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,820
Help from you?

406
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,100
More of themselves!

407
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,060
I already said goodbye to you, right?

408
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,340
Let's say you're a celebrity.

409
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,760
How much appearance money could you soak up if there was more than one of you?

410
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,480
Burn bright, be everywhere, ride the wave until it falls on you.

411
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,720
See where I'm going with this?

412
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,360
Not even a little.

413
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,280
Don't play dumb.

414
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:46,880
Hmm…

415
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,460
They could use holophores.

416
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,840
They already do that, man.

417
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm talking about actual appearances.

418
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,140
So what?

419
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,080
You're going to invent a way to see the future so you can clone the people who are going to be celebrities?

420
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,500
Come for a ride with me.

421
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,580
Washington, Capitol City Station.

422
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,260
Anyone wishing to exit at Capitol City, please listen carefully.

423
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,560
Pardon me.

424
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,800
Hey, what do you think you're…

425
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,920
It's you.

426
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,200
Is that who it is?

427
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,980
No, I mean it's really you.

428
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,180
The cranky old man on the CP.

429
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,740
How do you know?

430
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,820
Did you find a victim?

431
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,920
I just knew.

432
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,040
I knew what you would be like.

433
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,700
What am I like?

434
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,200
Inconspicuous, dressed like a divorce bureaucrat.

435
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,540
I am a divorce bureaucrat.

436
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,320
Come, take a walk with me.

437
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,380
What if I don't want to?

438
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,720
Three close personal friends of the guy who fell off your roof last week have my house staked out.

439
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,800
Wouldn't you like to know why?

440
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh my god.

441
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,540
So come, walk with me already.

442
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,340
How did you know I would be on that train?

443
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,180
I am a very old, enormously talented spy, Ronnie.

444
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,580
I've been running agents since the year your mother learned to ride a bike.

445
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,160
I know how your mind works.

446
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,140
I know you better than you know yourself.

447
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,260
Yeah, but how did you really know?

448
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,740
You put a bug in your purse.

449
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,640
Damn it.

450
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,040
It reminds me, once you start getting your extra pay from my department, buy yourself some decent accessories.

451
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,800
Your idea of business clothes makes you look like a Sunday school teacher.

452
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,700
What?

453
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,820
You pompous old Washington son of a…

454
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,040
Oh, wow.

455
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,640
Nice lab.

456
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,140
They do plastic surgery research here.

457
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,760
So anyway, Kamal, how hard is it to flash clone somebody?

458
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,360
Flash cloning is illegal.

459
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,160
Illegal, sure.

460
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,580
Hacking the CP probably is too.

461
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,580
I mean like child porn illegal, Aiden.

462
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,460
Come on.

463
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,300
Sentence to memory modification illegal.

464
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,360
It's not that serious.

465
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,040
I looked it up.

466
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,680
Okay, okay.

467
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,600
I'm going to humor you.

468
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,540
Let's say we wanted to flash clone a vid star, which I don't.

469
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,160
But let's just say we wanted to flash clone a vid star.

470
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,940
That's it.

471
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,140
Let that finely tuned brain of yours begin to hum.

472
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,240
First we'd have to have access to the star's DNA.

473
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,160
Look around, DNA collection central.

474
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,760
And we throw in a facelift for free.

475
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,820
Aiden, what are we going to do with our clones when the original isn't famous anymore?

476
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,440
Have you thought about any of this stuff?

477
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,320
Thought about it.

478
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,540
I've got investors.

479
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,380
Investors?

480
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,280
What I need is a feasibility study.

481
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,600
Feasibility study?

482
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,000
You're the doctor scientist.

483
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,100
Do doctor scientist stuff.

484
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:16,940
Research.

485
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,760
Tell me what we need to do.

486
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,120
Let me guess.

487
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,380
According to section three…

488
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,400
There is no device.

489
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,860
So where is it now?

490
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,860
I'm really sorry about this.

491
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,040
Tala Base.

492
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,800
The base where I work.

493
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:33,860
Ronnie…

494
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,260
You got me this job in the first place, didn't you?

495
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,040
You and that low down scheming Professor Avi, you set me up so you would have a pawn on the inside.

496
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,680
You think I don't have problems of my own?

497
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,520
In my day, we didn't complain when someone offered us a job.

498
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,800
No, sir.

499
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,260
Well, this is my day.

500
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,540
And I don't know.

501
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,060
I'm thinking I might quit and go home.

502
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,240
But I'm afraid y'all won't let me.

503
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,140
You're going to have to be a little brave, Ronnie.

504
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,220
I'm sorry about that, but the times don't give us many choices these days.

505
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,500
There's a young man up on an orbital platform tonight.

506
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,380
Please don't.

507
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,900
I really don't want you to know about him.

508
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,600
Ronnie, I have my enemies, but I have my friends, too.

509
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,820
They're watching over you.

510
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,460
Take a little comfort from that.

511
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,160
Okay, I'll try.

512
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,840
Get on your train.

513
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,440
Go home.

514
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,780
Go to work like nothing happens.

515
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,180
All I ask is that you keep your eyes open.

516
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,020
Can you do that?

517
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,920
Oh, yes.

518
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,200
Remembering to keep them shut is the problem.

519
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,540
Oh, you love the steak here.

520
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,900
You can really taste the soy.

521
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,180
Okay, it doesn't work.

522
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,540
What do you mean it doesn't work?

523
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,280
Of course it works.

524
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,880
Flash clones aren't just like rubber stamps of the original.

525
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,140
But close, right?

526
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,640
You take an embryo and develop it a hundred times faster than it would have naturally.

527
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,480
What you get is something different.

528
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
So we do plastic surgery to make them look great.

529
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,340
Hell, you could do that, couldn't you?

530
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,480
That isn't what I study.

531
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,060
Big deal.

532
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,640
Study it now.

533
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,080
Aidan, all these anomalies pop up because flash clones are forced to go through time too fast.

534
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,380
Come on.

535
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,440
No science gap.

536
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,500
Give me the executive summary.

537
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,540
Okay, flash clones don't know how to talk.

538
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,940
They don't have to talk.

539
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,380
Stars wave and smile, Kamal.

540
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,640
They walk down red carpets and show off their clothes.

541
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,080
Nobody wants to hear them talk.

542
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,920
Well, they don't know how to wave and smile either.

543
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,700
Home again?

544
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,620
Clones don't have any muscle memory.

545
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,640
No training like you and I just got observing people while we were crowing.

546
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:28,680
Okay, okay.

547
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:28,900
Whatever.

548
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,560
It doesn't matter.

549
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,100
We'll prop them up behind tables, put sunglasses on them and make them look arrogant and bored.

550
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,140
People love that.

551
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,260
Also, they'll drool like babies.

552
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,640
We'll make sure they've got managers with them.

553
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,720
Miss Popstar doesn't believe that this role fully realizes her artistic integrity.

554
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,700
Aidan Christ, will you listen to me?

555
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,280
You can train them intensive therapy, but after a year or two they start to degenerate.

556
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,400
Metabolic instability.

557
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,560
That takes care of the problem of what to do with them afterwards, right?

558
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,160
Oh, God.

559
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:04,660
About the time you might get them to be coherent, to talk and walk, all these little errors in their systems add up and you get a metabolic cascade failure.

560
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,140
Hey, you okay?

561
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,740
Oh my God.

562
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,500
Yes, ma'am.

563
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,180
Hey!

564
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,020
Hey, where you going?

565
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,300
Is this seat taken?

566
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,520
No.

567
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,440
Oh, no.

568
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,060
Go ahead.

569
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,480
Thanks.

570
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,500
Name's Joe.

571
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,040
Hey, I'm Ronnie.

572
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,820
I'm going to New York.

573
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,440
You going to New York?

574
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,120
Boston.

575
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:37,880
Boston?

576
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,320
Huh.

577
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,240
Well, I'm headed to New York.

578
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,060
Three days of leave.

579
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,680
I mean to use them.

580
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,840
I gathered.

581
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,100
Ever been to Coney Island at night?

582
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,360
Nope.

583
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,680
You ought to go.

584
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,900
Hey, we could go tonight.

585
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,820
Thanks, but I should be getting back.

586
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,880
You know, we could kick around town, have some laughs, maybe get some good-

587
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,120
Listen, I appreciate the offer.

588
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,240
I truly do.

589
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,820
And I bet you're a really swell hell jumper.

590
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,360
How do you know I'm-

591
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,580
And I'm flattered, you would ask.

592
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,480
Hey, cute girl on a train.

593
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,800
But I already have a boyfriend.

594
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,760
I don't see a boyfriend.

595
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,920
You don't give up easily, do you?

596
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,580
ODST, baby.

597
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,420
They pound the quit right out of us.

598
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,600
They do a good job.

599
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,100
Hey, which reminds me, how did you-

600
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,260
Oh, women's intuition.

601
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,180
Plus the campaign tattoos on your scalp and the gold comet logo on your bag.

602
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,760
Whoa, sharp.

603
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,480
Hey, I'll do you.

604
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,160
Joe, I'm not talking to you anymore.

605
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,880
I got it.

606
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,840
Sunday school teacher.

607
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,460
I am not a Sunday school teacher.

608
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,140
I thought you weren't talking to me.

609
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,060
Come on, your boyfriend will never know.

610
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,400
You're insufferable.

611
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,100
You're cute.

612
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,980
You're married.

613
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,620
Now, there's where you're wrong.

614
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,040
Joe, you think girls don't know what that untanned circle around your fourth finger means?

615
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,800
If some tart buys your line of sleeves, it's because she decided to, not because she was too dumb to notice you slipped your wedding ring off that morning.

616
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,840
And I should tell the guys in the unit that.

617
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,000
Save on drink bills.

618
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,040
Go back to your wife and leave me alone.

619
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,140
The wife and I are separated.

620
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,960
Meaning she's not on this train?

621
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,260
Meaning she's dead.

622
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,760
Oh.

623
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,260
She bought it on Reach.

624
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,620
Are you sure?

625
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,120
But there were a lot of survivors on Reach for some reason.

626
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,680
Maybe she made it through.

627
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,780
No, she didn't.

628
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,240
I'm sorry.

629
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,180
She always said.

630
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,140
She said, Joe, if I buy it, I want you to keep living.

631
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,060
I want you to.

632
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,800
What was her name?

633
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:36,520
Maggie.

634
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,780
That's a nice name.

635
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,520
Don't you believe I used to be good at picking up girls?

636
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,820
Joe, you were never good at picking up girls.

637
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,840
Maggie was just merciful.

638
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,180
Ain't that the truth?

639
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,100
My boyfriend's up on one of the orbital platforms.

640
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,720
He'll be okay there.

641
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,820
They're pretty safe.

642
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,940
You really think so?

643
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,580
Oh yeah.

644
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:00,980
Thanks.

645
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,340
So what do you say?

646
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,220
What?

647
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,120
You, me, Coney Island?

648
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,000
Joe, I can't.

649
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,160
Let me guess.

650
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,360
Your boy got called up, you shared a tearful goodbye.

651
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,860
He told you how he might never be coming back, and you gave it up for him.

652
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,780
No.

653
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,300
He told you he would always remember you.

654
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,020
Oh, it wasn't like that at all.

655
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,460
I see those guys the day after, Ronnie.

656
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,000
Nick would never lie to me.

657
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,380
Lying doesn't look the same when you think you're gonna die.

658
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,820
No, Nick wouldn't.

659
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,940
When you think you're gonna die, you take what you can get, any way you can.

660
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Next stop, Manhattan Station.

661
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,840
There will be no further talk before Harvard Square, Boston.

662
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,860
Manhattan Station.

663
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
Come out with me tonight, Sunday School.

664
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,260
I can't.

665
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,900
Okay?

666
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,320
I'm so sorry about Maggie.

667
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,480
You still don't see it, do you?

668
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,140
I'm not the only soldier here.

669
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,480
The Covenant's coming, Ronnie.

670
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,680
You better take what you can get.

671
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,340
Last stop.

672
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,020
She left you, Joe.

673
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:09,900
Yeah.

674
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,460
I know.

675
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,680
Come on.

676
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,740
What are you…

677
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,740
You look awful.

678
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:32,840
I gotta…

679
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,340
I gotta talk to someone.

680
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,520
You better come in.

681
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,180
Sit down.

682
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,700
I shouldn't be here.

683
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,140
What if Aiden…

684
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,600
I'll deal with Aiden.

685
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,420
What's wrong?

686
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,240
Did Aiden tell you about his father?

687
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,680
Aiden and I don't talk about his business.

688
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,420
He'd rather buy me shoes.

689
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,260
Listen, if you need me to go home, I can go home.

690
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,060
Can I get you something?

691
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,540
You're white as a ghost.

692
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,420
Let me get you some water.

693
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,000
Lately, Aiden's been coming to me with his weekly scheme.

694
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:08,880
Yeah?

695
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,600
Well, he shows up two or three days ago saying he's got this great new idea.

696
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,440
He wants to clone pop stars.

697
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,140
I mean, flash clone them.

698
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,920
Here, drink.

699
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,720
Thanks.

700
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,400
Flash clones, that's kind of different for him.

701
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,780
You mean most of his ideas aren't felonious?

702
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,400
Well, they're not that blatant anyway.

703
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,900
I said I'd look into it just so I could explain to him why it couldn't be done.

704
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,820
And…

705
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,300
Drink.

706
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,140
I did.

707
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,960
I did explain it to him.

708
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:41,180
I was telling him, listen, these people, these clones, they can't walk, they can't talk, they always degenerate.

709
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,740
Their systems break down.

710
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,720
Their metabolisms.

711
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,160
Oh.

712
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,880
Oh my God.

713
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,060
Your sister.

714
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:48,560
No!

715
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,140
Not my sister.

716
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,240
That's the point.

717
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:51,840
Oh.

718
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:52,800
Come on.

719
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,480
We never brought her home from the hospital, Sophie.

720
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,200
That thing wasn't her.

721
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,200
It was a flash clone.

722
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:00,760
Oh.

723
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,460
The whole time.

724
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,860
Yasmin, where was she, Sophie?

725
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,020
If that was a flash clone in my house, where was my sister?

726
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,640
Come on.

727
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,220
Waiting for me to come and get her, Sophie.

728
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,700
Waiting for me to come and get her.

729
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,640
And I never came.

730
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,080
Shh.

731
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,080
Come on.

732
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,320
I never came.

733
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,940
You didn't know.
