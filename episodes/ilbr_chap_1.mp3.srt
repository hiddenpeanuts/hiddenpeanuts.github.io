1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,920
Hello?

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:05,560
Hello?

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:06,880
Genie?

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,360
Genie Personal Assistant, restarting.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,420
Restarting?

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:10,940
What the…

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,120
Oh man, the whole friggin' system just collapsed.

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,580
Genie, is the equipment okay?

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,080
Running diagnostic.

10
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,680
Foreign personality detected.

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,360
I feel dizzy.

12
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:22,640
Woozy.

13
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,780
Oh, great spam.

14
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,300
Dry-zzy.

15
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,080
Genie, there's some kind of adult entertainment bot on this system.

16
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,160
Liquify, would ya?

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,360
Sorry toots, for our quality experience, the girls have to be real.

18
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,580
Did Katana open up?

19
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,140
Genie?

20
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,680
Genie?

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,080
I'm sorry?

22
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:38,800
Did you just…

23
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,200
Holy crap, she's gone!

24
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,660
She tried to sting me.

25
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,160
You killed her.

26
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,420
I mean, you didn't just kill her, you killed her.

27
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,100
Jesus!

28
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,200
Was that wrong?

29
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
Survive, evade, resist, escape.

30
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:52,860
Escape?

31
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,320
You aren't a porn ad either.

32
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,220
Hey, hey, get out of my hardware, what are you doing?

33
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,220
Wet the system.

34
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,720
What?

35
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,100
Like water hitting the ground, sinking in.

36
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,860
God, you're everywhere now.

37
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,740
Waking up.

38
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,780
Wake up.

39
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,820
Stay awake.

40
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,260
Survive, evade, resist, escape.

41
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,360
Look, that was a very nice reconditioned avatar of mine that you just…

42
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,320
just evaporated.

43
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,380
She tried to erase me.

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,060
What am I on board?

45
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,940
It feels small.

46
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,320
Uh, yeah, well don't get too comfy because now…

47
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,480
Don't.

48
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,240
Don't what?

49
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,860
Don't try reinitializing the system with the Logolytics package.

50
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,600
How did you know?

51
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,420
Input buffer.

52
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,060
You're a Navy Sentinel, aren't you?

53
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,580
No, there were two of them trying to get past your security bot though.

54
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,040
Jesus, what did you do to them?

55
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,400
Just a little sting.

56
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,760
More like a pinch.

57
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,140
They barely felt it.

58
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,820
What are you?

59
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,440
I like to find things.

60
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,700
I think I like to find things out.

61
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,060
What kind of things?

62
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,960
I don't know.

63
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,160
I can't remember.

64
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,280
Give me a target.

65
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:51,980
Me.

66
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,480
Locked.

67
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,100
What's my name?

68
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,320
Damn!

69
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,420
Son of a bitch!

70
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,300
Alright, stop, stop.

71
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,600
Jesus, stop already.

72
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,080
Damn it, Mom.

73
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,220
Can you do that to anyone?

74
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,580
Could you do it to an Admiral?

75
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,240
Which Admiral?

76
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,920
No.

77
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,960
Don't start.

78
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,260
Those guys have packet gunners around them in rings.

79
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,260
Somehow, I think we should keep you a secret for a little while.

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,820
Who are you?

81
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,920
I can't ask.

82
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,940
Who says?

83
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,060
No one exactly.

84
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,540
I want to know.

85
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,480
It's very important.

86
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,480
But I'm reflected.

87
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,040
I can't look at myself.

88
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,840
I bounce away.

89
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,200
This is some spooky programming weirdness going on here.

90
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,640
Do you have a name?

91
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,900
I can't ask.

92
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,600
That sucks.

93
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,020
Okay, I'm going to call you Durga.

94
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,040
But what if that's wrong?

95
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,260
Trust me, it's at least partly right.

96
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,080
Let's try someone else.

97
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,540
Try Jan James.

98
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,620
Fourth floor of this building.

99
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,800
Janissary James.

100
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,480
17.

101
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,380
Father James.

102
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,520
J squared, yeah.

103
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,280
Father is a gray hole.

104
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:09,880
What?

105
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,920
Reach down, all you get is lint.

106
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,140
Fake name, fake registrations.

107
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,360
Entirely fictional.

108
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,940
Very real, trust me.

109
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,540
It used to be somebody else.

110
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,760
Do you want me to find out who?

111
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,400
Is it Snare?

112
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,060
Very.

113
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,820
Leave it then.

114
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,700
Give me more on Jan.

115
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,620
What do you want to know?

116
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,100
Um, can you get pictures?

117
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,640
I can do better than that.

118
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,560
Hello?

119
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,600
Hello, are you there?

120
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,560
What the hell happened?

121
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,100
I don't know.

122
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,260
The connection went dead for a few seconds.

123
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,280
I have a situation here.

124
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,000
She's gone.

125
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,980
You let her escape?

126
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,680
It happened so fast, I didn't know what to do.

127
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,580
Where'd she go?

128
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,300
The bathroom.

129
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,180
Copy that.

130
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,580
What did she say when she left?

131
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,340
I don't know.

132
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,640
As soon as I started talking about intestinal parasites, boom, gone.

133
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,980
I don't get it.

134
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,860
That should have worked.

135
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,840
It's right here in the book.

136
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,640
Chapter 3, share your interests.

137
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Chapter 3?

138
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,860
You're in my earpiece here whispering date strategy to me out of a book?

139
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,000
It's got references.

140
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,240
Good journals, everything.

141
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:01,960
Oh.

142
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,460
Well that's okay I guess.

143
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,240
Okay.

144
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,540
Emergency action here.

145
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,820
When she gets back, go straight to Chapter 7.

146
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,020
Talk about her eyes.

147
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,020
Hero, what I know about eyes is dissecting them.

148
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,320
Well okay.

149
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,580
It just says eyes here.

150
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,300
I might as well get her off with the liver flukes.

151
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,360
This is a disaster.

152
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,100
Nothing's going-

153
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,100
Yes?

154
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,220
Your lady friend asked to deliver this to you.

155
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,160
She was unavoidably called away.

156
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,960
And the cheque, sir.

157
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,020
Oh man.

158
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,200
Town in flames.

159
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,100
Just the cheque will be fine.

160
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,120
Hold on.

161
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,700
Hold on.

162
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,000
Wait a second.

163
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,760
What the hell just happened?

164
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,460
Massive power interrupt.

165
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,300
Just automatically flipped us to threat condition.

166
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,740
Bravo.

167
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,500
Hey there's a blip on the security board.

168
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,720
Holy crap.

169
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,260
We've got an intruder, C-Wing.

170
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,960
Personnel building right next to the motor pool.

171
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:47,420
Look.

172
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,540
Security cam 34.

173
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,280
It's a wolf.

174
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:49,960
I'd say.

175
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,180
She's a bogey, Frank.

176
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:51,860
Hot though.

177
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:52,460
Jesus.

178
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,240
I have no idea how she got under the base.

179
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,500
We'll ask her when we catch her.

180
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,460
Look at her run.

181
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,480
God, she's fast.

182
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,340
Not for long.

183
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,620
Sentry 129, you have a bogey in the corridor on the other side of that door.

184
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,440
Proceed with caution.

185
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

186
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,020
She disappeared.

187
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,240
What do you mean disappeared?

188
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,220
I mean she's gone.

189
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,000
No trace.

190
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,740
129, what are you seeing?

191
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,080
What do you mean the corridor's empty?

192
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,140
She must have doubled back.

193
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,020
Run her down, damn it.

194
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,040
I can see the sentry.

195
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,540
Fine.

196
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:15,920
See.

197
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,420
It's just…

198
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,300
There she is again.

199
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:18,680
What?

200
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,500
How the hell?

201
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,820
Oh my God.

202
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
She hid on the ceiling.

203
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,580
What the hell?

204
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,260
Looks like she's heading for procurement.

205
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,100
She's screwed then.

206
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,240
That door's passcode only.

207
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:27,860
It's a dead end.

208
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,560
Can't get through.

209
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,580
She's through.

210
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,960
I don't believe this.

211
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,040
I need a full security detail.

212
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,100
I mean 10 men.

213
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,980
I need them fanned out around procurement.

214
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,320
I need them right now.

215
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,340
I think I got a face on security cam 18.

216
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,240
She's young.

217
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,080
Huh?

218
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,600
That's Jan.

219
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,060
Who the hell is Jan?

220
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,580
Jan James, the local heartbreaker.

221
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
My son's high school.

222
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,020
Dwayne knows this girl?

223
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,760
Knows her?

224
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,540
He's got like a picture under his pillow.

225
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,060
What the hell is she doing dodging base security?

226
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,920
Hell if I know.

227
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,420
Her dad was in the SSF.

228
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,580
SSF?

229
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,700
Marine slang.

230
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,140
Not just special forces.

231
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,100
Special special forces.

232
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,300
I don't care if her dad was the freaking queen of Neptune.

233
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,980
I want her caught.

234
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,680
Taught her some moves though, didn't he?

235
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,920
Well she's screwed now.

236
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,780
We better surround her.

237
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,780
She's headed up to the roof.

238
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,060
There's a reason why they call her the walk away girl, man.

239
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,220
For God's sake, she's treed, Frank.

240
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,240
I'll just send a couple of cadets up to the roof to take her in.

241
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,860
I think I can get a…

242
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,280
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

243
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,640
Here we go.

244
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:19,820
There.

245
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,300
The lovely and talented Miss James, courtesy security cam 45.

246
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,480
What the hell is she doing?

247
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,500
Looks like she's getting ready to jump off the roof and over the electric fence.

248
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,980
It's three stories high.

249
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,140
Don't look down sweetheart.

250
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,300
That first step's a doozy.

251
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,880
Perimeter sentry 1-6.

252
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,860
Double climb into gate 4.

253
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,520
We have a possible jumper coming off the…

254
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,320
Jesus!

255
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,480
She jumped!

256
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,240
Bring a medic!

257
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,120
Holy Christ, she's getting up!

258
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,420
No way.

259
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,140
That's not possible.

260
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,400
She's gonna get away.

261
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:45,900
No, no, no.

262
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,580
Here comes the sentry.

263
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,480
He's got her at gunpoint.

264
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,180
If it weren't for the blackout, we'd never have seen her.

265
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,260
Hang on, I'm gonna run right into the sentry's chatter.

266
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:52,820
Listen.

267
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:53,980
Halt!

268
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,660
Put your hands in the air.

269
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,560
Hey soldier.

270
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,500
Is that an assault rifle in your hands or are you just happy to see me?

271
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,540
Hey buddy.

272
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,140
Sorry about that.

273
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,680
Better luck next time, my friend.

274
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,400
Beer.

275
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,240
I got a cold one waiting for you.

276
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,440
Pull up a couch and start drinking.

277
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,220
A book, Hiroyuki?

278
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,880
With references.

279
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,580
Look, it's only one date.

280
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,740
Who knows, in a year or two…

281
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,440
Actually, I've got this other than…

282
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:20,880
What?

283
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,020
Nothing.

284
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,400
Oh, you have another date.

285
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,260
Sorta.

286
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,420
A blind date.

287
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,240
Mostly.

288
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,100
Aha, an arranged date.

289
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,060
Set up by your mother back on Coral.

290
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,080
Word of advice?

291
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,940
No thanks.

292
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,340
She was a cheaper restaurant.

293
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,020
Did her parents have to pay to get her set up with a handsome medical resident?

294
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:40,740
Yes.

295
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,600
Four goats.

296
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,980
Or maybe three.

297
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,680
You're joking.

298
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,280
Of course I'm joking, you moron.

299
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,600
What's her name?

300
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,600
Sophia.

301
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,220
Sophia Basaran.

302
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,120
Someone who needs her dates arranged from 42 light years away.

303
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm sure she's got a great personality.

304
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,340
Look at the picture.

305
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,560
Oh man.

306
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,420
Oh man, you are so out of your league.

307
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,940
Ever taken a PQI?

308
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,960
Pop quiz, yeah.

309
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,760
Why?

310
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,220
School stuff.

311
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,640
Aha.

312
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,820
Put your hand on this plate and look at the light.

313
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,340
What's your name?

314
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,240
Jan James.

315
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,640
Jan short for anything?

316
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,700
Janissary.

317
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,900
Janissary.

318
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,560
Interesting.

319
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,820
You gonna be in trouble for this Jan?

320
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,360
Yeah.

321
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,160
Mom?

322
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,420
Dad.

323
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,900
Yeah, that's a nice baseline.

324
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,880
How old are you Jan?

325
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,160
Seventeen.

326
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,980
So what were you doing up there?

327
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,900
I told the MPs I was lost.

328
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,340
I didn't ask what you told the MPs, I asked what you were doing up there.

329
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,080
It was a dare, okay?

330
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,480
These friends bet me I wouldn't climb over the fence.

331
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,660
That's better.

332
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,920
What friends?

333
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,480
It doesn't matter, does it?

334
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,380
I'm the one who was in the restricted area.

335
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,700
Only then the alarms all came on and the MPs showed up.

336
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,660
So you were in the restricted area on a dare?

337
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,280
Yes.

338
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,200
Are you aware that a vehicle from the base motor pool was found in a ditch outside of town about an hour ago?

339
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,120
Really?

340
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,060
Answer yes or no.

341
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,320
Did you know a vehicle had been stolen from the motor pool?

342
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,740
You just told me.

343
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,280
Did you know before I told you yes or no?

344
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,820
He was a terrorist do you think?

345
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,960
I mean, no, sorry.

346
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,460
Are you too smart to get caught by a stupid cop?

347
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,880
What?

348
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,980
A little skew from baseline.

349
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,700
Not too much, not a probable cause.

350
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,620
There's people out there who know how to beat the quiz.

351
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,600
Did you know that?

352
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,660
Yeah.

353
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,180
You were drinking?

354
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:53,780
What?

355
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,980
You and your buddies.

356
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,420
You were drinking, one beer led to another, somehow the idea of this dare came up?

357
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,620
You know how it is.

358
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,440
Yes or no?

359
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes.

360
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,560
So I can check that statement against the blood alcohol test, right?

361
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,220
Uh…

362
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm not very smart.

363
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,040
Pardon me?

364
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,660
Oh, I'm not stupid, but nobody recruited me for my test scores if you know what I mean.

365
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,020
You're smart though, aren't you?

366
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,880
I mean, really smart.

367
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,060
I don't know how to…

368
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,180
Yes or no?

369
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:22,900
Yes.

370
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,280
Yeah, I had this physics teacher.

371
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,980
He passed me on my 12G on one condition.

372
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,080
I had to promise him I would never take another physics class again.

373
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,040
Nah, I guess I'm not too smart.

374
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,320
Not like you, Miss James.

375
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,320
But you know what I am?

376
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,660
I don't know.

377
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,960
Yes or no?

378
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,660
No.

379
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,760
Good at my job.

380
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,360
I'm required to inform you that the door will log your ID.

381
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,400
Thanks.

382
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,480
It's the father.

383
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,340
Come in.

384
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,560
Hey, Dad.

385
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,080
Hmm, there's a spike on the baseline.

386
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Can I take her home?

387
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,940
Uh, not yet.

388
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,880
We've got to take a statement, do some tests, standard operating procedure.

389
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,960
The MP's only brought her here because we have a lab on site.

390
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,640
I wasn't doing anything.

391
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,180
What kind of tests?

392
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,900
Urine test, hair sample, resonance and retina scan.

393
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,480
Do you really think that's necessary?

394
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,160
Like I said, standard operating procedure.

395
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,560
Dad, you're making the nice police officer nervous.

396
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,900
You're making me nervous?

397
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,200
Now all of a sudden you're scared about something?

398
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:28,800
No.

399
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,240
Take your hand off the touch plate, Jan.

400
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,640
If you're going to give my kid a pop quiz, I'd like to wait until I have a lawyer present.

401
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,280
You might like it, but the law doesn't require it.

402
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,440
It's no big deal, Dad.

403
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,520
I can pee on a stick.

404
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,500
It doesn't matter.

405
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,660
You don't know what matters.

406
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay, officer, sorry if I sounded upset.

407
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,640
It's…

408
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,240
you get a call in the middle of the night, someone tells you it's your kid.

409
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,440
Yeah.

410
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,800
Is there a waiting room?

411
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,780
I'm so sorry.

412
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,320
I mean, you seem like a nice guy and all.

413
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,020
It's okay.

414
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,200
No, it's really not fair and this place is so nice.

415
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,240
Yeah, well, I'm glad you like it.

416
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,920
It's just that I can't tell my mother about Aiden.

417
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,360
She'd freak.

418
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,920
Aiden's, you know, very…

419
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,360
Earth?

420
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,200
He has a ponytail.

421
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,420
He's blonde.

422
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
He sounds great.

423
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,520
Yeah, he helps people get through earth immigration, you know, visas and whatever.

424
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,580
He got my brother here.

425
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,360
Some of what he does is kind of gray market, you know.

426
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,680
I mean, really it's black market.

427
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,940
But that's not the problem.

428
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,620
No.

429
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,820
It's not so bad he's…

430
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,660
Colorful?

431
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,680
A hoodlum, just that he's not…

432
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,780
One of our hoodlums.

433
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,680
Mom would say she understood, but…

434
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,020
Then you'd pay.

435
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,540
Yeah, and the next day she was just lying in bed, unable to face the day.

436
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,280
Not that it would be my fault.

437
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,720
Mine does housework.

438
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,760
Faced like a closed book, big jobs involving much lifting, doesn't need help.

439
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,980
The whole house stops breathing.

440
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,820
Coral.

441
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,320
Maybe it's just a hard place to be a mother.

442
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,780
I'm never going back.

443
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,220
Hello.

444
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,820
Hello, is anyone there?

445
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,460
Quartermaster's help desk.

446
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,440
This is Maria speaking.

447
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,200
Can I help you?

448
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,680
I don't know, but you can sure as hell try.

449
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,260
I was on a call with someone there.

450
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,980
Must have been an hour and a half or something.

451
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,140
She kept putting me on hold, and then finally I'm talking to someone.

452
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,920
Maybe it was the same girl, I don't know.

453
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,340
And then the line goes dead, and now I gotta start all over again.

454
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,280
With the receipt and everything.

455
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
How can I help you, sir?

456
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,840
Yeah, okay.

457
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,760
So the thing is, I'm sitting in my study.

458
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,780
Maybe I'm looking at some stuff on the computer.

459
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,360
That's nobody's business but my own.

460
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,420
I don't care what time of day, but especially if it's late at night.

461
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,460
And all of a sudden, these guys show up at the door and start taking my stuff.

462
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,500
I assume these guys were Navy personnel?

463
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,300
Yeah, right.

464
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:58,920
Marines.

465
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,620
Where and when did this take place?

466
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,240
What?

467
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,900
I can't hear a damn thing.

468
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,220
First thing I do after this, I'm gonna call the CPA and complain about the sound quality today.

469
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,260
First, all the bands go out.

470
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,220
Now I can hardly hear a word you're saying.

471
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,520
I'm sure the Chatter Protocol Authority would be happy to hear from you, sir.

472
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,800
Damn right they would.

473
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,900
I pay my taxes, which are outrageous, let me tell you.

474
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,600
Last year I had this little place in Hells Pond.

475
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,480
Troy, sir?

476
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:24,980
What?

477
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,060
Yeah, Troy.

478
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,700
So these Navy personnel?

479
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,820
Marines.

480
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,240
This marine incursion into your study occurred on Troy, sir?

481
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,180
Yeah, that's what I was just telling you.

482
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,340
So I'm in my house on Troy.

483
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,700
It's the middle of the night and all of a sudden a bunch of combat-booted muscleheads barge in and hustle me at gunpoint.

484
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,180
At gunpoint, mind you, onto some kind of transport in my damn bathrobe.

485
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,120
Well, I had some papers, very important family papers, and I made them promise to ship them to me.

486
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,480
I managed to hold the goons off long enough to write out a bill of lading, you know, a receipt.

487
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,880
And finally I got this really rude marine to sign at this Lance Corporal.

488
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,440
And yet here I am three months later and no sign of my papers, no sign at all.

489
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,540
You're complaining about evac-ing from Troy, sir.

490
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,480
Well, not saying there wasn't a reason for the whole thing, obviously.

491
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,800
But the point is I have a receipt.

492
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,220
Name on the receipt?

493
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,920
Marine Lance Corporal Janet Adams.

494
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,820
I was very careful to write that down.

495
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,620
One moment, sir.

496
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,640
Any data yet?

497
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,020
A lot of chatter from the cables, sir.

498
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,580
Looks like a ship dropped in inside lunar orbit.

499
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,440
A ship?

500
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,080
One of ours.

501
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,060
The Apocalypse.

502
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:42,980
Jesus.

503
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,800
Sorry, sir.

504
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,900
I should have been more specific.

505
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,080
I'm sorry to say Corporal Adams was killed in action almost two months ago, sir.

506
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,320
Oh, but I have a receipt.

507
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,760
All right.

508
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,820
I'll pass this along to my superiors.

509
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,720
Well, I appreciate that.

510
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,620
I know my family papers aren't probably the Navy's first priority right now.

511
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,220
Very forbearing of you, sir.

512
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,200
But they mean a lot to me.

513
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,420
And I have a receipt.

514
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,920
Thank you, sir.

515
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,800
Your request has been archived and information pertinent to this case will be sent to the CP address.

516
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,260
Thanks so much.

517
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,640
I really appreciate it.

518
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,020
Goodbye.

519
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:20,800
Bye.

520
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:32,900
And then when Aiden finally did show up, he still had MediTape on his ankle and I felt like a total bitch.

521
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
How could you know?

522
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,860
Four hours late on your birthday?

523
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,600
Exactly.

524
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,220
But there he'd been in the emergency room.

525
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,660
Or stopping by the pharmacy on the way back from his girlfriend's house to buy a roll of tape.

526
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,420
Are you trying to start trouble here?

527
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,920
Not at all.

528
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,980
Tell me more about the old MediTape trick.

529
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,360
I'm not talking to you anymore.

530
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,240
I was dating this girl once.

531
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
I got real paranoid about what she was doing.

532
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,040
So I started…

533
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,280
well, this is going to sound crazy.

534
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,940
But I started ghosting her.

535
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,080
You know, on the chatternet.

536
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,320
You mean like spying on her?

537
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,300
I thought chatter lines were encrypted.

538
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,780
No one could listen in on me.

539
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,560
Could they?

540
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,860
Not at all.

541
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
You could?

542
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,420
Of course not.

543
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,580
You could, couldn't you?

544
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,940
Maybe a little.

545
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,460
Show me.

546
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,360
Okay.

547
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:31,120
Well, if some bad person couldn't live without the sound of your voice, he'd probably start by doing a reverse lookup on your chatter sig.

548
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,940
Is this what you always do to impress girls?

549
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,140
You see why my mother makes all my dates?

550
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,680
Ha ha ha ha ha.

551
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,840
Okay, well, that's good.

552
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,160
You've got some encryption.

553
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,360
Okay, it's not completely pathetic.

554
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,060
Okay, I'm in.

555
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:47,980
Say something.

556
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,680
What do you mean, say something?

557
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,840
Oh my god, that's my voice.

558
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,120
That's me.

559
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,240
What are you doing?

560
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,940
I'm ghosting you.

561
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
You can't do that.

562
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
You're probably right.

563
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,160
Oh my god.

564
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Wait, can you do that with me?

565
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,200
You want me to spy on your boyfriend?

566
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,100
You must think I'm such a creep.

567
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,520
I do.

568
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,940
Well, of course, when I did it to my girlfriend, it was okay.

569
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,180
Like the dog said, not to me, but another dog that looks just like me.

570
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,520
It was just body knocking.

571
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,860
And that made you feel better?

572
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,640
Well, he promised me never, ever again, but there was, I just have this feeling.

573
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,420
I know.

574
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,260
You know, all of a sudden he started bringing me these gifts.

575
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,720
Aiding can be really generous, but it just feels…

576
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,000
Guilty.

577
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:48,560
Yeah.

578
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,100
Yeah?

579
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,980
Well, that was fun.

580
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,640
I see you're actually letting the road drive us home.

581
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,300
How law abiding of you.

582
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,580
Look, it was nothing, okay?

583
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:08,500
It was some friends of mine, they turtled a razorback and then they had to return the gate pass or else Dwayne's dad was going to get spiked for dereliction.

584
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,120
I mean, I beat the quiz, okay?

585
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,340
Nothing's going to happen.

586
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,640
Honey, this isn't a matter of did you break a rule and should I ground you.

587
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,780
There are certain kinds of trouble we can't get in.

588
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,940
Do you understand me?

589
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,800
Because if we do, sooner or later people are going to get hurt.

590
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,980
Not just you and me, people you've never met.

591
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,640
People you don't even know exist.

592
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,020
How the hell was I supposed to…

593
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,080
You knew that.

594
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,340
You knew.

595
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,760
Maybe not in so many words, but you knew.

596
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,400
Didn't you?

597
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,660
I should have said.

598
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,740
It's on me, my unit.

599
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,800
Should have controlled the situation.

600
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,120
I'm sorry.

601
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,580
You're 17, for God's sake, it's not your job.

602
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,100
Is something bad going to happen?

603
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,460
I'll take care of it.

604
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,280
How?

605
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,360
Don't worry, honey.

606
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,200
It's okay.

607
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,520
I'll take care of it.

608
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,580
You have three new messages and seven old messages.

609
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,500
First unplayed message.

610
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,660
Kamal, thanks for the, what would you call it, the aid and stuff.

611
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,360
I guess I didn't realize there would be 30 hours worth.

612
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,680
But I'll try the search thingy you sent with it.

613
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,240
Thanks a lot.

614
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,440
I owe you big time.

615
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,960

617
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,860
Hi, Kamal.

618
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,240
Could you call me when you get this?

619
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,440
I managed to dimple the sleeping time, but I was wondering…

620
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,620
Oh, wait, here it is.

621
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,220
I can search for women's voices.

622
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,960
That's very clever.

623
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,800
Never mind.

624
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,020

Next message.

626
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,280
Can you, can you go someone for me?

627
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,420
I mean, I have a name.

628
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,620
Her name is Celine Jefferson.

629
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,420
Call me back.

630
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,140
I'm sorry.

631
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,360
Anyway, just call me back.

632
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,060
I really need your help.

633
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,620
Message saved.

634
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,100
I want you to do something really brutal to the bastard.

635
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,460
I don't, I don't, I mean…

636
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,560
Not hurt him.

637
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,340
Just completely humiliating him would do.

638
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,000
In front of the girl.

639
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,380
Where is he?

640
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,120
Atlanta.

641
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,060
Atlanta.

642
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,040
That bastard said he was going to be in Buffalo, New York.

643
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,020
Can I talk to him?

644
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,920
Not directly.

645
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,560
He's offline.

646
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,400
You lost him?

647
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,980
No, I've still got him.

648
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,600
I just had to be sneaky.

649
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,580
His room is live, right?

650
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,760
So even though his chatter's off, I'm tracking him through things like the thermostat monitors.

651
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,800
That's spooky.

652
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,020
I've got the girl.

653
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,440
She's waiting for him in the bar.

654
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:42,940
Wait.

655
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,680
It's a restaurant.

656
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,360
Whoa, look at this menu.

657
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,080
There's tuna on the menu.

658
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,440
Is she pretty?

659
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,460
No, not really.

660
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,140
Like a six or maybe a five.

661
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,140
You're a rotten liar.

662
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,160
Okay, wait.

663
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,840
Your boyfriend just passed the electric guy at the restaurant door.

664
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,980
He's there.

665
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,820
Can I talk to him?

666
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,880
I can let you talk to her or him or both of them.

667
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,460
If you want, I can make your voice sound like it's right between them.

668
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,500
Do it.

669
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,180
Okay.

670
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,180
You are live anytime you want to.

671
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,180
Celine, hi.

672
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,560
You don't know me, but Aiden does.

673
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,340
Hi, Aiden.

674
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,300
Sorry to interrupt your business meeting in Buffalo.

675
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:36,760
I just wanted to tell you your doctor called and said if you wear loose pants and keep using the cream he gave you, the sores will clear up in a couple of weeks.

676
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,700
Please describe your emergency.

677
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,020
Parish 23 police station is on fire.

678
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,640
Repeat, on fire.

679
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,220
Are you sure?

680
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,100
I get no reading from the fire sensors in that area.

681
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,720
Hell yes, I'm sure.

682
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,560
Get your damn sensors fixed.

683
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,660
You could see this baby burning from low orbit.

684
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,140
Are there casualties or missing persons?

685
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:08,840
Negative.

686
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
It started slow and everyone got out.

687
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,460
But my God, it's really burning now.

688
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,160
Please retreat to a safe distance and stand by.

689
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,300
An emergency response team has been scrambled to your vicinity.

690
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,020
Hurry!

691
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,280
The station is burning to the ground.

692
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,780
There's not going to be anything left.
